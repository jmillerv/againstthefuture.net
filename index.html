         	<p>Six days into using my Fuji X100F and it&rsquo;s a very different experience than the Canon. I feel like even when I used a fixed lens I could get the multiple planes to be largely in focus. I never had the opportunity to get a fixed 35mm equivalent on my Canon.  This camera seems to want to really focus on one plane at a time and I haven&rsquo;t been able to get a good shot where the entire frame is in focus yet. I think this is just a matter of practice and perhaps taking pictures where more of what is in frame is important.</p>

<p>I am also woefully out of practice and I&rsquo;m not ruling that out as part of it.</p>

<p><strong>DOI</strong> 10.1515/humaff-2019-0007 | <strong>Author(s)</strong> ANNA ŠESTÁKOVÁ, JANA PLICHTOVÁ | <strong>Date</strong> 2019</p>

<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>

<p>This paper looks at the sharing economy or &lsquo;digital platform economy&rsquo; as a new commons. The authors first ground the paper in Elinor Ostrom&rsquo;s work on the commons and the design principles necessary for a sustainable commons. They then examine how Ostrom&rsquo;s work can be applied to the digital platform economy of bikesharing. The authors conclude that Ostrom&rsquo;s framework would need to be adapted for use in urbanand digitalized environments. Further, they note that it may be difficult to create a framework for all use cases and adapting these principles may need be stratified along different types of sharing.</p>

<h2 id="quote-and-observations">Quote and Observations</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Creating a system based on letting people use someone else&rsquo;s under-utilised resources means that they no longer need to buy them. The sharing economy is seen as means to avoid over-consumption and pollution while providing access to resources for the less well-off, the poor, people with disabilities and low-income communities.&rdquo; (75-76).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Working from a US context I think, on its face, this isn&rsquo;t true. In NYC, for example, getting from the Bronx to Manhattan via a a ride-sharing app is going to be more expensive than using the train. Additionally, there is evidence that ride-sharing services actually increase congestion in the city, which would cause an increase in car based emissions.</p>

<p>A few paragraphs down the authors point out that ride-sharing can move people from more sustainable transit and cheap accommodations may increase people&rsquo;s travel habits which results in net higher emissions (76).</p>

<p>For a common to exist there must be</p>

<blockquote>
<ol>
<li><p>a shared resource (material or immaterial)</p></li>

<li><p>rights and rules that specify how the resource is shared between the commoners which can be rooted in a legal property regime (contract law, patent law, copyright law, etc) or in customary law;</p></li>

<li><p>a governance system for the resource which assures the respect of the rights and obligations of the commoners and outsiders.  (77)</p></li>
</ol>
</blockquote>

<p>Responding to Hardin&rsquo;s critique the author&rsquo;s turn to Elinor Ostrom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Some of the successful communities were able to manage their common resources for a very long period of time. For example, the Valencian irrigation system in Spain is more than 1,000 years old. The mountain-grazing institutions in Switzerland extend back to the thirteenth century (Ostrom, 1994). The successful cases no only survived droughts, floods, wars and so on but also major economic and political changes.&rdquo;</p>

<h3 id="eight-design-principles">Eight Design Principles</h3>

<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>Boundaries should be clearly defined. If not clearly defined the resource will be fully open to outsiders which could put the resource at risk of being designed by outsiders.</li>
<li>Unless the pool of users is so small that they will have no impact on each other, they must institute rules on when and how much resource can be authorized to do so. Additionally, the rules must considered fair and legitimate by the users and adapted to local conditions.</li>
<li>Users should be able to participate in creating and modifying rules. Rules can be based on legal systems or community created informal rules.</li>
<li>Compliance with rules is monitored because people not obeying the rules could jeopardize the system.</li>
<li>Observed violations of the rules should be punished. It need not be harsh and can be graduated. Repeated rule breakers are eventually excluded from the group. Sanctions can come from other users or officials.</li>
<li>Users have access to areas for discussion and conflict resolution. &ldquo;Ostrom&rsquo;s empirical work showed that while rules are often unambiguous in theory, this is rarely the case in reality. If the disagreements are not resolved, then the actors may loser their willingness to follow them, simply because the others interpret the rules in a different way.&rdquo; (78)</li>
<li>A minimal recognition of the right to organize from external authorities (read: the government), else the rules could be overturned be overturned by the government.</li>
<li>Nested enterprises. &ldquo;All of the activities in the common-pool resources including appropriation, monitoring, conflict resolution and sanctions are often organised in multiple layers of nested enterprises. The smaller problems should be resolved in smaller groups while the externalities from one group to others can be addressed in larger organisational settings.&rdquo; (79)</li>
</ol>

<p>(78-79)</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="bikesharing-in-bratislava">Bikesharing in Bratislava</h3>

<p>&ldquo;A common problem is the locking system &ndash; some users do not lock the bike properly making it impossible for other users to borrow it. On social media, some people complained that other users do not return the bikes within the 30 minute limit. they park them in the docking station so they can take them again and continue cycling for free. This complaint is especially interesting considering the company itself suggests such practicies on its website. Some users, however, deem this kind of behavior to be damaging to the idea of &lsquo;sharing&rsquo;. We consider this a sign of an informal rule developing which contradicts the formal rules of the providers.&rdquo; (80)</p>

<p>As they examine bikesharing they note both that in the case studies cited in Ostrom&rsquo;s work users&rsquo; livelihoods were dependent on preserving the resource. Bikesharing barriers to entry are kept intentionally low to encourage more people to use them and Ostrom&rsquo;s principles of setting strict boundaries has a tension with the stated principles of democratizing access to resources (81). I&rsquo;m cynical that these public private parternships that introduce a resource for a fee are about democratizing access. They more appear to be an effort for governments to abdicate the responsibility of governance to an outside corporation and for the corporation to have a guaranteed revenue stream backed by a government entity..</p>

<p>Bikes as a resource differ from a natural resource in that a bike does not naturally replenish nor can someone use a bike simultaneously (where you could while fishing a lake (81).</p>

<p>Heterogeneity of users makes a self-governed system difficult to implement.</p>

<p>DOI 10.1016/j.compcom.2010.06.006 | Author Annette Vee | Date 2010</p>

<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>

<p>Dr. Annette Vee looks at the relationship between writing and the encroachment of patent law into the domain of writing (traditionally writing is the domain of copyright law). She examines the arguments from both programmers and legal scholars as to why patents are a poor regime for code by pointing to the fact that creation is more akin to traditional writing endeavors than engineering or manufacturing. Additionally Vee looks to instances where, rather that spur innovation, patent law actively prohibits it. With large swathes of the population able to write code and much of today&rsquo;s acitivities being mediated through software she argues that patent law is no longer fit for the contexts of code composition.</p>

<h2 id="quotes-and-observations">Quotes and Observations</h2>

<p>&ldquo;Copyright law pays attention to the composition process behind a work of authorship whereas patent law does not. To prove copyright infringement, a rights holder must demonstrate that at some point during composition the accused actually copied the copyrighted work.&rdquo; (183)</p>

<p>&ldquo;The conditions of novelty and nonobviousness have been poorly applied to software patents in particular, in part because the patent examiner&rsquo;s manual does not suggest a review of prior art located in software.&rdquo; (183)</p>

<p>&ldquo;Controversies surrounding software patents began as early as the 1960s, when technologies were developing so quickly that President Johnson put together a special commission to review the USPTO’s policies and methods. The Commission, made up of academics, scientists, and industry representatives, recommended in its 1966 report that legislation be introduced to expressly exempt computer programs as patentable subject matter (Samuelson, 1990). No such legislation was passed; however, the USPTO examiner’s guide indicated that computer programs were not patentable under either the “process” or “machine” category described in 35 U.S.C. §101 (Samuelson, 1990). Two Supreme Court rulings in the 1970s affirmed the idea that computer programs were unpatentable; decisions in Gottschalk v. Benson (1972) and Parker v. Flook (1978) both indicated that the algorithms under review were not far enough removed from pure math to make them patentable.&rdquo; (184)</p>

<p>&ldquo;The CAFC ruling In Re Alappat (1994) indicated that simply using the terminology of “machine”
renders the invention a physical device. The CAFC decision that finally opened the floodgates on software patents was State Street Bank and Trust v. Signature Financial Group (1998), which unambiguously confirmed that an algorithm run by a computer—that is, software—was patentable, as long as it was useful. &ldquo; (184)</p>

<p>&ldquo;The fact that many working programmers do not want the protection that patents give them should be a critical sign that something is wrong with the system.&rdquo; (185)</p>

<p>&ldquo;Prior art for software could be located in manuals academic papers, the Internet, closed-code proprietary software, in-house business programs, and even people&rsquo;s home computers&ndash;in other words, too many places to be feasibly searched.&rdquo; (186)</p>

<p>&ldquo;The histories of writing and math both yield a number of resource-poor writers and
mathematicians such as Frederick Douglass, the writer, or Srinivasa Ramanujan, the self-taught mathematician, who were able to practice their skill to the great benefit of society. Patent law now throws obstacles in the way of the future Douglasses and Ramanujans of programming because it posits the context of software writing to be like engineering or chemistry, with high-investment costs and centralized publishing venues. However, as code literacy becomes more widespread and decentralized, the compositional context for computer code becomes more akin to writing than engineering.  &ldquo; (187)</p>

<p>&ldquo;The organization of open-source projects is generally loose, and like Laughlin the independent programmer, open source organizations or individual programmers lack the resources of lawyers and capital that are required to file for patents. Proof of prior art may be in the code, but if it is not in case law or in writing, it is less accessible for the purposes of legal defense. &rdquo; (189)</p>

<p>&ldquo;Code has become infrastructural to the way we compose and, indeed, to the very way that we live our lives. Software mediates almost all of our financial transactions, our communications, and our information outlets and inlets. Behind each program are millions of lines of code written by thousands of professional and hobbyist programmers in hundreds of different languages. Because patent law is nearly impossible for non-specialists to take advantage of or even interpret, it does not mesh well with a decentralized
composition scenario.&rdquo; (190)</p>

<p><strong>Exploration</strong> Ace [spades]</p>

<hr />

<p>Hugo is gone for a while. A long while. I sit in the camp for as long as I can but the flickering light of the candelabra and the dull throb of my ankle aren&rsquo;t the best company. I pull out the map and study it. The encounter with the gargoyle has me considering returning home but it&rsquo;s then I remember that there is nothing  athome. I took the map because it&rsquo;s all that was left in the ruins. Crossing this stupid sea and following this heirloom map won&rsquo;t bring anyone back or re-unite me with them, but trodding this path will make me feel closer to my my family. My village.</p>

<p>Staring at the map fails to give me any new insights. I take out the map Hugo gave me and it&rsquo;s too much new information to take in. Forward motion is the only thing I think I can focus on right now. Where is Hugo? It&rsquo;s been half a day. We need to be getting on. I&rsquo;m not sure this island can even sustain us for much longer and I have enough provisions to cross the sea and get to town for one, but I&rsquo;m not going to let Hugo starve. At this point he&rsquo;s saved my life more than me getting him off this island would save his.</p>

<p>I make my way to our lean-to and lay down. I don&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;ll be leaving today and the events of the last two days have me more drained than I was planning on being this early in the journey. I close my eyes but it&rsquo;s too humid to simply drift away. Eventually, I am able to force myself to sleep.</p>

<p>In the distance I hear something being dragged and some heavy huffing. &ldquo;Hugo,&rdquo; I call out. More huffing. I stand uneasy and limp out of the lean-to. Hugo is dragging something..</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry yourself,&rdquo; Hugo says as I move closer,  &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll put weight on your bad leg if you help.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is this?&rdquo; I ask. I could see that it was some sort of chest but I wanted to hear how he left with a jeweled cane handle and came back with this. I notice the handle resting on a belt he fashioned out of string I gave him from my provisions.</p>

<p>He inhales, &ldquo;Well, you won&rsquo;t believe it but I went in search of a fine piece of wood to carve your cane out of.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You left this morning! What took so long?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t mean to worry you. It&rsquo;s just when I was looking for the perfect piece of wood I went towards the middle of the isle, figuring the trees would be older, sturdier, have more options. You know?&rdquo;</p>

<p>I wasn&rsquo;t sure where this was going, &ldquo;And?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m at this tree because I haven&rsquo;t found anything good on the ground. I figured I&rsquo;d just take something and dry it out. I mean we&rsquo;ll be rowing and just baking under the candelabra. Probably can dry out right quick. You know?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; I say.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And with us taking turns rowing&hellip;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I get it,&rdquo; I cut him off, a day of waiting has left me impatient, &ldquo;You&rsquo;d have time to work on carving it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes. So, I&rsquo;m in front of this tree and I&rsquo;m about to climb it. But something&rsquo;s not right,&rdquo; he pauses with an annoying dramatic flair, &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a bump in the ground.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Seems perfectly normal to me,&rdquo; I say.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s where you and I view the world differently. Been around long enough to know trees. These here on the isles don&rsquo;t root like mainland trees. Shouldn&rsquo;t be weird bulges.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Okay.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So, I start digging.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You start digging? Based on what?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He pauses and looks into my eyes,&ldquo;The bulge &ndash; something&rsquo;s not right.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not sure if it was how he said it or taking the effort to lock his gaze with mine but something about that statement unnerved me, &ldquo;I think I have to take your word for it on this one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You do, because I was right,&rdquo; he gestures to the chest, &ldquo;I found some pirate treasure.&rdquo; He smiles.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pirate treasure?&ldquo;I smirk.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yep. Just like yer handle. Has to be a pirate.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why haven&rsquo;t you opened it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Locked. I figure you might be able to do something.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What am I going to do with a locked chest?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He smiles, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t play with me here. I&rsquo;ve seen the runes in your journal. I watched you not only survive a gargoyle attack, but a fall from near the rafters. There&rsquo;s a magic coursing through you. Maybe you&rsquo;re not very good with it, but you have it&rdquo;</p>

<p>Hugo&rsquo;s not wrong. I&rsquo;ve had an affinity for the same magic that powers the Rooks since I was a child. Never terribly controlled and only since adulthood have I been able to muster any control over it. I didn&rsquo;t survive the fall with magic though. Or at least not a single spell came to mind as I watched what was surely my death rapidly approaching.  &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never worked a lock with magic,&rdquo; I tell him.</p>

<p>His eyes widened as though I wasn&rsquo;t understanding his intent, &ldquo;Must you be gentle with it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>I could see that he wasn&rsquo;t going to relent on this one. &ldquo;Move it where I can sit in front of it more comfortably.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We get the chest in a position where I can kneel in front of it. There&rsquo;s a keyhole, metal. The rest of it is made of a heavy wood. I can work with this. I touch two fingers to the keyhole and begin reciting one of the earliest incantations I learned. I raise my other hand to the sky palm out. I don&rsquo;t need much I just need the ambient static from the air. Inhaling and exhaling I can feel the electricity dancing on my palm. I concentrate and let it gather. Finally, I pull it through my body, focus the energy, and loose the concentrated electricity through my fingertips and into the key hole. The wood cracks from the force of the enrgy but the lock becomes a molten mass and begins oozing down the chest.</p>

<p>I exhale and stand. My legs went numb from kneeling and the letting electricity flow through my body always leaves me drained even though it&rsquo;s not shocking me or, maybe, I&rsquo;m somehow inured to it. Either way it&rsquo;s exhausting. &ldquo;Have at it,&rdquo; I say to Hugo.</p>

<p>I sit in the sand and Hugo opens the chest. He&rsquo;s more confused than anything. I watch as he reaches in and pulls out the treasure. It looks like a simple pair of women&rsquo;s boots.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Must have been a lady pirate,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;Are they your size?&rdquo; Hugo hands me the boots. The leather-work is excellent but more than that at the ankles there is an insignia of some kind. Maybe it&rsquo;s from the shoemaker, that would make sense. I study the insignia and realize that it&rsquo;s a rune. A strange dialect of the runic language. Old. Maybe even ancient. The rune doesn&rsquo;t look like anything to avoid. I put the boots on and pace back and forth in front of Hugo.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Get you some winners?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think so,&rdquo; I reply.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You know it&rsquo;s starting to feel a little unfair that everything so far has been for you. Where&rsquo;s Hugo&rsquo;s due?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll get you something fancy on the mainland. Or if you are in a hurry, you can have these things but you have to wait for the gargoyles to pick you off after I give them to you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He smiled, &ldquo;Did you crack a joke, miss?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My luck is in. Be a shame to sour that with my typical poor mood.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The boots felt better than what I was wearing and while my ankle still throbbed a bit it wasn&rsquo;t as bad as earlier in the day. Almost like I could move at my normal pace in these boots. Was it their magic in the boots&rsquo; rune?</p>

<h2 id="author-s-note">Author&rsquo;s Note</h2>

<p>*The cards have been all items lately. This last one is a treasure so I tried to write something to make it work. It&rsquo;s feeling a little conspicuous at the moment but I thought there would be some more challenges for my character after getting plucked from the ground by a gargoyle. Hopefully there&rsquo;s fear to come</p>

<p>The rules for an Ace of Spades are to find a treasure and increase the exploration or combat score by 1. I can&rsquo;t increase combat any further so I picked something for locomotion.

<hr />

<p>When I arrive back at camp and show Hugo my find. He&rsquo;s not too disturbed by the idea of a skeleton this far out. &ldquo;Old island. You hadn&rsquo;t come along, I&rsquo;d be right a pile of bones before too long myself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I ask if he thinks we can repair the jeweled cane. He eyes the split in the shaft, &ldquo;I know where to get just the thing. I set up some traps to try and snag something a while back. &ldquo;Wait here. I mean you can come if you want, but-&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No thanks,I&rsquo;m good on walking for today. I&rsquo;ll see if staying off the foot helps at all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>ISSN: 2380-3312 | Author(s): Anita Say Chan| Date:  2018</p>

<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>

<p>Anita Say Chan presents the decolonial interventions and critiques of global knowledge production that asserts Western thought as &ldquo;universal scientific truths&rdquo;. She then walks us through how these interventions work to disrupt the dominant framework and how, given the instability of Western liberalism, now is the time for new, alternative political imaginaries.</p>

<h2 id="quotes-and-observations">Quotes and Observations</h2>

<p>&ldquo;As such, decolonialists posed the significance of how cultivating a politics of decentralization -[sic] and a de-centering of the self as expert and knowledge practitioner &ndash; might offer an affront to modernity&rsquo;s domination and its politics of self-replication through the occupation of other epistemologies&rdquo; (2)</p>

<p>&ldquo;Imagining technological futures with and in between the interfaces of the diverse forms of knowledge practice that come alive among them &ndash; and that can come together across differences, rather than in spite of it &ndash; instead becomes a key resource for imagining new digital futures (Tsing, 2005)&rdquo; (3)</p>

<p><strong>Exploration</strong> 5 [diamond] | <strong>Event</strong> King [Spades]</p>

<hr />

<p>I could feel the heat of the candelabra before I opened my eyes, but a throbbing coursed through my body, overpowering any feelings that would normally come with being woken by the gentle flicker. <em>The gargoyle</em>. I plummeted from the rafters. I shouldn&rsquo;t be alive. I open my eyes and see that someone&rsquo;s applied a splint. Hugo? I stand and try to place some weight on my right foot. A flash of pain runs up my leg. Too tender.</p>

<p>Hugo chides me from the camp fire, &ldquo;Glad you&rsquo;re alive, but you need to take it easy,&rdquo; he turns a spit and he looks back to me, relieved, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re made of tougher stuff than I thought. Don&rsquo;t know many people who survive an encounter with a gargoyle.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I limp towards the fire, &ldquo;You ever seen one of those before?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not in my life. When you arrived I thought my prayers were answered, but now I&rsquo;m so sure.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He was joking, but I couldn&rsquo;t stand jokes right now. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not trying to be visited by gargoyles either, you know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Hugo moved on, &ldquo;Do you think we&rsquo;ll be able to row out of here today or do you need more rest?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I want off the island as soon as possible,&rdquo; I say hobbling towards him. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to get used to limping before midday and then we&rsquo;re going to get out of here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No need to rush. What&rsquo;s a few more days here to me when I thought I&rsquo;d die here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A few more days means never finding the lock to this key. &ldquo;You might understand that I&rsquo;m not too keen to sleep beneath this gargoyle&rsquo;s rafters for another day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Hugo could tell I was in no mood for discussion, &ldquo;I caught us some fish, have one.&rdquo; He took a spit from the fire and passed it to me.</p>

<p>Unsure of how exactly to approach eating it I bit into it through the skin. Surprisingly, I liked the skin the most. But I realized eating like this would pose some problems what with the bones I began picking at it. &ldquo;Thank you.&rdquo; I mumbled through mouthfuls.</p>

<p>He nodded but let me sit in silence while I ate. We let the fire burn out on its own. &ldquo;I need to try and walk. I&rsquo;ll yell if I need anything.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I shuffled off and limped along the beach staying close to the tree line so that I wouldn&rsquo;t bee so easily spotted from the rafters. I focused on pointing out obvious things to myself to dull the painand then I noticed a footpath that cut through the foliage. I look back checking my distance from the camp &ndash; maybe a 70 yards. I took the opportunity to go beneath the canopy.</p>

<p>It was early enough in the day that the light filtering through the trees still felt a little like pre-dawn. Despite my condition this place was pretty. Prettier than the cities. Not a lot of greenery where I&rsquo;m from.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fuck,&rdquo; I yell as my injured foot slams into something and I tumble forward. I throw myself into the fall and allow myself to just stop rolling when I&rsquo;m on my back doing my best to keep my injured side elevated. I sigh and let my leg down gently. I scan for my attacker. To my right I see a leather boot. I crawl backward and call out, &ldquo;hello?&rdquo;</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s no reply. I roll onto my stomach and push myself onto a knee and then my feet. I draw my sword and push away the foliage. The hollow eyes of a motionless skeleton stare back. To my own surprise, I don&rsquo;t recoil. It&rsquo;s been here too long to be Hugo&rsquo;s friend and it&rsquo;s clutching something. A cane? Or is it a scepter? The skeleton&rsquo;s clothes have mostly disintegrated but the cane is in decent shape so I pry the cane from its hands. Examining it, I notice the shaft is split down the middle, but possesses a jeweled handle. Maybe Hugo and I could repair it and I&rsquo;ll have an aid until my ankle heals.</p>

<p>I take this find back to camp hoping we can make something of it.</p>

<p>Source: <a href="https://doi.org/10.1145/3342194">doi.org/10.1145/3&hellip;</a> | Author(s): John Gastil, Todd Davies | Date: January 2020</p>

<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>

<p>The authors divide the stages of online deliberations into four eras. They then note that while the current era, Social Media, has, on its face, the most potential for democratic engagement the system is held captive by the power of these platforms and that they are for profit institutions that have no regard for their impact on democracy. Their solution suggests we take from the history of broadcasting and making something like the Corporation for Public Broadcasting for software, a Corporation for Public Software.</p>

<h2 id="quotes-and-observations">Quotes and Observations</h2>

<p>The authors divide online deliberation into four stages.</p>

<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>Early Visions of Electronic Democracy (~19070s - 1980s)</li>
<li>Public Internet (~1990s - early 2000s)</li>
<li>Social Media (~mid 2000s - present)</li>
<li>Public Software Stage (2)</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>

<p>The fourth stage is where they layout their vision for a future of technology &amp; digital democracy</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Theorists of this more advanced era of digital technology have hoped that it might restore our depleted social capital by expanding social networks and rebuilding citizens’ trust in each other and their shared institutions [Wells 2015]&rdquo; (2)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Is there any evidence that social media has done anything to build or rebuild trust in shared institutions? Definitely optimistic but is it rooted in reality?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;The social media platforms most widely used in Stage 3, however, are commercial services built and maintained by private corporations under a profit motive that is often at odds with users’ desires for privacy. At best, commercial social media tools such as Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter are built neither to help nor harm democratic engagement. Instead, a need for continuous advertising revenue drives their design—irrespective of what that means for democracy [McNamee 2019; Wu 2017].&rdquo; (2)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The authors also point out after this quote that the data dominance and the software patents held by these platforms prevents the entry of new tools, including non-commercial options.</p>

<p>In part 2 of the paper the authors assess the present social media landscape.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Market forces brought this reality into existence [O’Neil 2017], but deeper
problems in American democracy made our system vulnerable to manipulation and degradation long before the era of Social Media. &ldquo; (4)</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is halting movement toward building a more deliberative and democratic digital commons [Noveck 2018], but these efforts lack coordination and push against powerful obstacles [Howard 2015].  &ldquo; (4)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It seems that better anti-harassments tools, reigning in recommendation algorithms, and introducing friction that encourages critical engagement would be a top priority for creating a democratic digital commons.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;The world ended up using Facebook not because Zuckerberg decided users should do so but because users decided, collectively and one by one, to use Zuckerberg’s platform rather than dozens of alternatives. If Zuckerberg is guilty of crimes against democracy, then he has had 2.5 billion accomplices—the people around the globe who accepted Facebook’s terms of service and posted their data on its site. &rdquo; (5)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ignores the aggressive advertising and getting people to sign up and the difficulty of leaving Facebook due to a lack of interoperability and lock-in effects generated by much of civic life consolidating onto platforms that Facebook either built or purchased. But sure 2.5 billion people who accepted a contract of adherence are also responsible for the genocide in Myanmar, January 6th, and the nefarious ad surveillance technology they created simply because they were offered a service to use with their friends.</p>

<p>The authors are not opposed to regulation nor anti-trust enforcement but they believe the biggest issue is the lack of ambition in the scope and design of civic reforms (5).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;To those doubtful of the prospects for digital democratic reform, we point toward the example of Spain [Noveck 2018; Peña-López 2017; Smith 2018]. Barcelona and other municipalities adopted the open source software Consul (developed by a distributed team of programmers led by the San Francisco–headquartered firm HashiCorp) to create civic engagement opportunities. &ldquo; (6)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Should democratic tech orgs for other countries be situated in the US?  I need to go read about HashiCorp now.</p>

<p>They examine a tool called the <em>Platform for Online Deliberation</em> that was eventually renamed to <em>Deme</em>. It had the four following design principles:</p>

<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Supportiveness. The platform should support the group overall so that there is either an improvement or no decline in the ability of the group to meet the needs of its members or stakeholders.</li>
<li>Comprehensiveness. The platform should allow the group to accomplish, in an online environment, all of the usual deliberative tasks associated with face-to-face meetings.</li>
<li>Participation. The platform should maximize the number of desired participants in the group’s deliberations and minimize barriers to their participation.</li>
<li>Quality. The platform should facilitate a subjective quality of interaction and decision making that meets or exceeds what the group achieves in face-to-face meetings.  (8)</li>
</ul>

<p>&ldquo;The Web environment has become very complex, with security threats and patent infringement high on the list of challenges that were off the radar 16 years ago. One option is to throw up our hands and leave it to the commercial market to create what we need. If we do that, we are likely to get something more useful for asynchronous online deliberation than we have today, and in fact there are now widely used tools that do at least part of what Deme envisioned in 2003 (e.g., Google Docs, Discord, Loomio, and Nextdoor—all but Loomio are proprietary)  &rdquo; (9)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The market hasn&rsquo;t created what we need yet. Also, are we really going to throw in Nextdoor as a positive example. It&rsquo;s a system that preys on the fears of people and has a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/21283993/nextdoor-app-racism-community-moderation-guidance-protests">documented problem</a> with its users being racist.</p>

<h2 id="week-1-day-2">Week 1, Day 2</h2>

<p><strong>Exploration</strong> J [spade], 7 [diamond]</p>

<hr />

<p>You never sleep well in a new place. I woke up before the first flicker. Hugo didn&rsquo;t stir as I exited the lean-to. We talked well past darkness and I&rsquo;m not sure that I&rsquo;m the best coversationalist but a year imprisoned and a few weeks marooned would leave me enthused about talking to anyone. From what I can piece together he may have been imprisoned on that island for over a year. I packed my things up but I decided to stroll along the beach — keeping the boat within in eye shot.</p>

<p>I made my way to a rocky spot on the shoreline almost opposite where I landed. Several old ships seem to have run aground here. I can&rsquo;t fathom why that would be the case though. Perhaps the weather was more dangerous here once or maybe that prison island had something to do with it. A glint reflecting off the stone pulls me from my reverie. It&rsquo;s too bright to be naturally occurring. I step into the sea and the waves lap against my ankles. I can&rsquo;t get to it without swimming. I remove my tunic and pants and wade towards the source of the shine.</p>

<p>As I approach, above the sounds of the ocean I hear the clanking of metal. A leather belt with a gleaming blade is snagged on a rock jutting out of the ocean. The coming and going of the tide smacks the blade against the rock. As I tread the water and examine the sword I see it possesses an onyx pommel, and it&rsquo;s handle is wrapped in a water logged leather. The blade itself was clearly not steel for it was unbothered by rust and the&rsquo;re not a single defect in the metal despite being thrashed against the rocks.</p>

<p>I loose the belt from the rock and the sword comes with it. Awkwardly, I swim with one arm back to shore. I&rsquo;ve always preferred the mysteries of magic but this should do in a pinch. Maybe Hugo can use this.</p>

<p>I sit on the shore soaking wet. The Candleabra is brighter now. At least bright enough to dry out under. I sit for a spell until I&rsquo;m dry enough to put my clothes back on. I stand and give the blade a few obligatory swings. If I repair the handle, it&rsquo;ll be a fine blade.</p>

<p>I stroll back to the camp as I near it, I can smell the smoke of the fire and something cooking on it. Hugo managed to rustle something up. We&rsquo;re shaping up to set sail in good condition. When he looks to me, I wave and he waves back. As I get closer to the camp, he appears overtaken by terror.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wha-&rdquo; I couldn&rsquo;t even get words out before before I feel something pierce my back. I close my eyes from the pain and when I open them again Hugo, the boat, and the fire shrink fro my view. Everything clicks and adrenaline overpowers the pain. I&rsquo;m being taken by a Gargoyle. <em>The sword</em>!</p>

<p>I flail the sword wildly and send the belt is was looped through tumbling to the ground. Rivulets of blood run down my hand and forearm spray and the creature lets me go. The creature let me go. Shit! The tiny speck that once was Hugo and the camp again grow larger.</p>

<p>I hit the ground and try to roll out of it but something snaps upon impact. I see red and then black.</p>

<p>Source: <a href="https://sur.conectas.org/en/democracy-and-digital-technology/">International Journal of Human Rights</a> | Author: Ted Piccone | Date: July 26, 2018</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>

<p>The author reiterates the accepted narrative about that the principles the Internet was founded on. That it was designed to have de-centralized control and encourage a flow of cross-border information run largely by the private sector. While Internet history is ignored in this telling, the author identifies principles that a balkanized web would threaten. Piccone then makes recommendations for how we preserve and strengthen the web as we know it.</p>

<h2 id="quotes-and-observations">Quotes and Observations</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>&rdquo;&hellip;the increased digitisation of the pas two decades has created a &ldquo;chilling effect&rdquo; on free speech, where citizens in certain countries feel less safe to assert their opinions, knowing that their personal data are monitored or archived. (31)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The threat of digital blackouts is also grave and the author notes that in the first nine months of 2017 there were 60 documented shutdowns (31)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;The internet was founded on principles of decentralised self-organisation and trans-border information flow and is run mostly by private actors as a network of networks.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Was it founded on these principles? That is the narrative but  TCP/IP arises from a specific set of circumstances related to funding and technological constraints of the time (Emerson 2021).</p>

<p>The author claims that &ldquo;&hellip;growing assertion of internet regulation by nation states, and fragmentation across jurisdictional and territorial boundaries, increasingly threaten these principles.&rdquo; (32)</p>

<p>I have no doubt that internet Balkanization threatens the principles we have come to associate with the internet, I&rsquo;m not entirely sure that a homogenous web is better than a balkanized one. While I want to be able to talk with people all across the world, what if we had a pluralism of networks? With groups defining UI, protocols, interfaces, and standards to interact with each other?</p>

<p>As it stands, our communications flow through a handful of conglomerates and that certainly isn&rsquo;t better.</p>

<h3 id="policy-recommendations">Policy Recommendations</h3>

<p><strong>Protect Democratic Processes</strong>: designating the election system in the US as &lsquo;critical infrastructure&rsquo; would be a good start for requiring the cybersecurity of voting machines to be improved. (33) This can be done by:</p>

<p>1) not connecting  machines to a digital network and backing up the digital system.
2) open electoral data principles for establishing trust and auditing
3) detect and punish state sponsored hackings
4) develop protocols to facilitate the prosecution of cross border hacking
5) develop consensus that an attack on election systems infrastructure constitutes a physical attack. (summarized from 34)</p>

<p>As for the last point. I am not entirely certain that I want to embolden Western nations with reasons to physically respond to cyber-attacks. There are also questions of standards. Would supporting a coup through spy agencies fall under consensus that would justify an attack?</p>

<p><strong>Protect Human Rights Online</strong>: International commute should uphold and promote human rights and hold themselves to the standards they espouse.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Expand and support existing human rights laws</p></li>

<li><p>States should partner with civil society and the private sector to strengthen resolutions and develop proper norms for monitoring</p></li>

<li><p>The private sector must establish more rigorous safeguards to protect citizens from state and non-state actors.</p></li>

<li><p>Policies that place restrictions on web content and digital communications must be crafted with participation from stakeholders and must comply with international law with respect to privacy and due process</p>

<p>(summarized from 34-35)</p></li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Establish a Code of Internet Governance</strong>: a coalition of &ldquo;like-minded&rdquo; (35) states should create a working group from experts across industry and civil society to draft &amp; propose a voluntary code of internet governance.</p>

<p>1) The governance group should consider Council of Europe&rsquo;s Internet Governance Strategy and the Tallinn Agenda for Freedom Online.
2) Have the working group coordinate education and training on the relationship between human rights and digital technology
3) After establishing standards consider consequences for &ldquo;blatant offenders&rdquo; and they must also pose the question &ldquo;how should democracies address nations that attempt cyber attacks on their core democratic processes&rdquo;</p>

<p>This paper more seems a way to preserve the entire system we have here. These suggestions would not simply preserve democracy but they would still privilege Western countries and the multinational countries within them. While many of these recommendations and suggestions are worth implementing, this proposal does little for populations of people not living within the seats of power. It does nothing to challenge the owners of the vectors of information (Wark, 2019) through which data flows.</p>

<p><strong>Exploration</strong> 10 [diamond], J [diamond] | <strong>Event</strong> 8 [spade] | <strong>Item</strong> 10 [spade]</p>

<hr />

<p>I rowed for a few hours and I spied an island. Even though arms were beginning to fail me I was propelled by a towerjutting out from the land. I could barely make out a figure standing looking out from the tower &ndash; whatever stood theredidn&rsquo;t look human. While I don&rsquo;t have much to lose but this is the beginning of the journey and I&rsquo;m not trying to die on the Deadwe. I continued rowing and rowing and rowing. Eventually, I came upon a island populated with trees. The candelabra was already dimming. I needed to work quickly to have a shelter before nightfall. I dragged the boat into the trees hoping to use it as a lean-to.</p>

<p>As I was setting up camp I noticed smoke plumes rising not too far away. It looked controlled, like an ordinary camp fire. These isles are more populated than I thought. Cautiously, I treaded towards the plumes. A shell of human in threadbare cloth poked at a meager fire. He didn&rsquo;t look like he posed a threat to me or anyone at all. It was clear to me that his diet had been lean for sometime.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Excuse me,&rdquo; I said once I was within earshot .</p>

<p>The man leapt to his feat and put his fists up. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not here to hurt you.&rdquo; An iron ring of metal encircles each of his wrists and the chain has been broken off. &ldquo;Nor am I here to return you to prison?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He lowered his arms, &ldquo;If you&rsquo;re here to do neither of those can you get me off this island? You must have a boat, you&rsquo;re not wet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;May I ask how you got here?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You guessed right. I&rsquo;m an esacpee. My buddy and I were out fishing and we got captured
by those. Those. Well, I don&rsquo;t know what they are.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The island with the tower. &ldquo;I think I passed that island. I&rsquo;m Jane by the way. How did you escape? Where&rsquo;s your friend?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The man looked a little flustered, &ldquo;lots of questions. You&rsquo;re the first person I talked to in weeks.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Apologies. Take them one at a time.&rdquo; The man&rsquo;s ribcage was even more apparent when he lowered his fists.</p>

<p>I pulled a tin of nuts out of my rucksack, &ldquo;You may be a criminal, but you shouldn&rsquo;t starve. Eat these,&rdquo; I said handing them to the man.</p>

<p>The man stumbled forth and desperately took the tin from her hands. As he shoveled nuts into his mouth he muttered, &ldquo;Name&rsquo;s Hugo. Not a criminal. Fishing&rsquo;s no crime.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Broken manacles suggest otherwise,&rdquo; I said.</p>

<p>Hugo flushed, &ldquo;You&rsquo;d think them the criminals you knew what I been through.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I decided to take a seat next to his fire. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m here for the evening. What do you got?&rdquo; His story seemed likely. His body was covered in a patchwork of welts and bruises. They weren&rsquo;t fresh but they were there all the same.</p>

<p>Hugo shook his head, &ldquo;My buddy, Fynn. We  was fishing out fishing. Trying to do some deeper fishing. Drifted too close to that island I guess and three swift boats came out and captured us. Must of been in that hell hole for months. Only been here uhh,&rdquo; Hugo lifts the stick he was poking the fire with, &ldquo;I been on this island as many ticks this stick has.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He&rsquo;s been here for a little under two weeks. I guess he also wasn&rsquo;t being fed before he ended up here. &ldquo;So, what happened when they captured you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, they had us working on something. Mostly mining. Not something normal to mine though. I can&rsquo;t explain it. Beyond me. Some other prisoners figured something to do with Rooks. Fynn did thought so. He had a real mind for that sort of thing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What happened to Fynn?&rdquo; Hugo grimaced as I asked. Something tragic. Died at the camp maybe.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Listen, I just met you and haven&rsquo;t had any time to,&rdquo; his voice trails off.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your business is your business. Maybe save it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We escaped and I made it here. Barely. I&rsquo;d like off this island. I can&rsquo;t offer much, but I have this.&rdquo; Hugo reaches into a tattered sack.  Hugo pulls out a tiny, square container. It must be waterproof. His fingers work the container open and he pulls out a folded vellum map.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I stole this,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;A pretty detailed map. Has stuff I never seen or heard of. You seem to be on some sort of adventure. I&rsquo;ll give it to you now, if you get me out of here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The choice was pretty clear I could use a map and I couldn&rsquo;t let a man die here. &ldquo;Sure, I&rsquo;ll take it. Come back to my camp with me and we&rsquo;ll keep rowing tomorrow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where you headed?&rdquo; He asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Trying to cross the Deadwe.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He nods, &ldquo;Trying to get to the city?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I want to at least stop in a city.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m not from there but my fishing village not too far off. You get me home and I can get you oriented and provision. My family, well they probably think I&rsquo;m dead, so I can imagine they&rsquo;ll be grateful.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We need to rest up then if we&rsquo;re going to keep rowing. Who knows if the fair weather will hold.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>Exploration</strong>  8 [club], 9 [spade]</p>

<p>This isn&rsquo;t really the first day. It&rsquo;s just the first day something happened. I made my way to the Sandling Bay where the Deadwe Sea stretches before me. I&rsquo;m in luck. The waves are calm and the sky is clear. The bay is marked on the map and there&rsquo;s a poem from my childhood I can&rsquo;t quite remember. <em>When ye cross the Deadwe</em>&hellip; I don&rsquo;t remember how it goes just that once you make it across you find a boon for your journey. I didn&rsquo;t plan very well and I don&rsquo;t have a boat. I&rsquo;m going to need a way to cross &ndash; might need to find someone who can help me with that.</p>

<p>A footpath cutting through the vegatation caught my eye by no means a main road. I followed it a few hundred yardsand my luck must be in because covered in leaves was a small vessel. A small, two-person boat. Someone must have stashed it here for future use. Maybe a cousin built this and left it here. Or maybe it&rsquo;s someone else&rsquo;s. I make a route the area and pace through a few times before coming to the conclusion that no one is around and I&rsquo;m going to borrow this.</p>

<p>Source: loriemerson.net | Author: Lori Emerson | Date: August 14, 2021</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>

<p>Emerson asks how are we living out the structures created by TPC/IP? Why haven&rsquo;t we stopped and asked if the internet is finished yet? And why did we stop developing our infrastructure at TCP/IP?</p>

<p>Emerson argues that we must understand the technical specifications otherwise we get lost in the existing narrative of the internet being an American invention (and the exceptionalism that comes with such statements). She then investigates the history of TCP/IP and points out that the layered system of the Internet was created to future proof the system, but in doing so it also obscured how the system works from the masses. As it stands, the Internet gives the impression that &ldquo;it just works.&rdquo;</p>

<p>After going through the history of this architecture Emerson invites us to imagine an alternative by looking at the Recursive Internet Network Architecture (RINA) proposal. This is a specification designed from the ground up to function as a &ldquo;distributed Inter-Process Communication (IPC)&rdquo; repeating across different scopes. The author uses this specification to point out the impossibility of the Internet being both neutral and inherently good and encourages that TCP/IP be a starting point for investigating the power structures of the Internet.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="quotes-and-observations">Quotes and Observations</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>The internet is a &ldquo;closed open platform&rdquo; in that &ldquo;The internet is &ldquo;open&rdquo; in the sense that, from the point of view of the user, it is generally uncensored; and from the point of view of the engineer, it&rsquo;s open because TCP/IP makes possible the connection of any and all networks. But these foregoing characteristics do not mean that the net is fundamentally neutral or inherently a bastion for freedom.&rdquo; (2)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Emerson goes on to point out that the need for net neutrality does not mean that the net is inherently neutral.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s fairly common to point out the roots of the Internet in the American ARPANET which adopted the decentralized network structure of packet switching, creating multiple paths between nodes in the network rather than single pathways which could disrupt the whole network in the event of an attack or outage; however, packet swittching was also adopted by the French research network Cyclades and in fact ARPANET later adopted the connectionless or unreliable datagram structure implement by Cyclades in 1972. The Internet, then, is just as much French in origin as it is American&rdquo; (3)</p>

<p>&rdquo;&hellip;TCP/IP seems to have been created more out of the desire to not interfere with the burgeoning computer industry than it was to build an open and inclusive network for the good of the people.&rdquo; (3)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&rsquo;s interesting note that hardware, even keyboards were only recently standardized when the web was initially being built.</p>

<p>Despite the notion that anyone can come to the party and work on the protocol, of the 25ish engineers three came from one high school in the San Fernando Valley (5).</p>

<p>Packet switching was designed as a compliment to the phone service and internet protocol was not  designed to replace the telephone network nor was it optimized to support streaming media, like voice, video, and broadcasting (6). To a large extent TCP/IP is the dominant protocol simply because DARPA had the biggest budget and they invested heavily in it.</p>

<p>Eugene Thacker: &ldquo;the technical specs matter, ontologically and politically&rdquo;</p>

<p>All layers have the same functions they just operate on a different range of the problem. Where, in the 1970s, it was assumed that each layer had a different function (8).</p>

<p>This piece feels like it belongs in conversation with McKelvey&rsquo;s work in <em>Internet Daemons</em></p>

<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>

<p>Postcolonial theory focuses on British Empire and comes out of South Asian histiography (2). The authors caution against relying on narratives that focus too heavily on the impacts of British rule when indigenous populations of the Americas and the countries of South America have distinct impacts from US colonialism. The authors then navigate the ways in which decolonial and anti-colonial practices were used to reify imperial powers during the mid-twentieth-century. The conclude by focusing on how capitalism and technonationalism are able to not just valorize difference but to also &ldquo;massage, de-construct, and re-construct difference into forms that can live well with capital (Foucault, 2008 (1978-79)).&rdquo; (7)</p>

<h2 id="quotes-observations">Quotes &amp; Observations</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Without an analysis of capital and of power within difference, how do we decolonize new techno-nationalisms that re-invent indigeneity as modern power, while seeking legitimacy with ongoing imperial formations of the nation-state and capital?&rdquo; (3)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The authors then point out that globalization did not require a flattening of the world in order to increase their profits. In fact, they adopted the narratives of difference, indigeneity, and variation across the flows of capital. Examples of this include adding tandoori to a Pizza Hut menu or Bean Pastries in Shanghai (5). These efforts created resilient capital flows rather than a strong, sustained resistance to them. (6).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;The mid-twentieth-century transfer of sovereignty to formerly colonized nations was, in some imperial visions, regarded as a mere legal formalism &ndash; a transition to a different mode of white trusteeship in which imperial global influence was to be re-forged through novel economic and cultural mechanisms that would place markets rather than militaries, and trade rather than territory, at the center of global networks.&rdquo; (4)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I wonder if or how this dovetails with McKenzie Warck&rsquo;s work with Vectoralism? Where the mid-twentieth century had Western countries sowing debt, disorder, and economic strangulation in order to control companies, the present moment is focused on this same control through the exports of large multi-national technology companies.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Decolonization was not a straightforward, liberating process. Rather, it was a contest over the very meaning of liberation itself. As the century wore on, the terms of anti-colonial nationalism grew in many directions, including sectarian leftisms and authoritarian populisms. The anti-colonial coat served to cloak the holes in the spaces of practice, administration, and governance that needed to be repared; yet often it was expedient to continue inhabiting colonial institutional structures&rdquo; (5)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This quote is here to remind me to do further reading on the topic of decolonization appropriated by imperial powers towards their own ends.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;The World Bank, the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, and the US Department of State encourage start-ups, hackathons, and &ldquo;innovation cultures&rdquo; to redirect energized, dangerous Third World bodies away from terrorism into entrepreneurship.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This has echoes of the &ldquo;Learn to Code&rdquo; mantra in the US.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Firms do not simply try to obliterate difference; rather, they study difference as a tactic of transforming citizen-subjects into consumer-entrepreneurs through techniques of empathetic design thinking and NGO partnerships&rdquo; (7)</p>

<p>&ldquo;Culture and innovation industries now systematically take up counterhegemonic efforts, profitably stripping them of their activist intent (Costanza-Chock, 2018, p.12).&rdquo; A celebration of difference alone is not enough to sustain a pluriverse &ndash; a &ldquo;world where many worlds fit&rdquo; (Escobar, 2018, p.16).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>These last two pieces clearly elucidate the point that by and large capitalism can always co-opt a movement and have it exist within its own bounds. The point here that I find important is that <em>merely</em> decentralizing our computing infrastructure will not necessarily yield liberatory results.</p>

<hr />

<p>Starting the evening with a 2020 paper on the banking industry underestimating cloud migrations costs. This one was longer than I expected wen I moved it into my to read folder.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>

<p>The authors chose the banking industry because it was one of the first to adopt IT and banking products are ephemeral and more easily translate into digital services. (302).  The researchers were unable to do quantitative research because IT related costs are usually tracked as one general cost instead of being subdivided (302); however, the authors were able to organize costs discussed in the interviews into nine discrete categories.  They find that banks underestimate managing dependencies, the cost of re-architecting applications, hiring external contractors, and legislation. They conclude by noting that banks underestimate the costs and that the banks that participated in the study expected migration costs to further increase and become even more volatile. Furthermore, that because cloud computing is still a nascent technology with many unknowns, they caution IT managers to not approach cloud migration as a typical IT project.</p>

<h2 id="quotes-observations">Quotes &amp; Observations</h2>

<p>&ldquo;Cloud services can rarely be used immediately as it requires customization depending on business requirements, and positioning within the architecture.&rdquo; (301)</p>

<p>&ldquo;A stakeholder analysis identified significatn disadvantages to the benefits, long term costs were volatile and to a certain extent vendor lock0in occurred to the diffusion of control and dependency on the cloud vendor&rdquo; (301)</p>

<p>&ldquo;Cloud vendors pledge lower costs with their &ldquo;pay-per-use&rdquo; utility slogan. However fail to distinguish which components are standard and which components require re-work for which a company needs to pay for.&rdquo; (301)</p>

<p>&ldquo;Data storage, outsourcing data of customers and privacy sensitivity are underestimated problems&rdquo; (308). In addition to this, without overarching legislation many countries have their own set of rules.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Most banks do not manage cloud migration costs separately, which does not contribute to understanding and predicting cloud migration costs.&rdquo; (308)</p>

<h3 id="five-migration-strategies">Five Migration strategies</h3>

<p><strong>Rehost</strong>: &ldquo;The application is running in and Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) environment. Cloud is basically approached as a data center. The benefits from cloud will not be reaped with this strategy and it is difficult to scale&rdquo; (301)</p>

<p><strong>Refactor</strong>: &ldquo;Enables developers to re-use langauges, code, and containers. As a result the application is &ldquo;cloud native&rdquo;. This might pose framework lock-in and is not loosely coupled.&rdquo; (302)</p>

<p><strong>Revise</strong>: &ldquo;The application will be altered extensively prior to the cloud migration. The current code will be modified. This is the case for legacy applications/end of life applications which requrie revision. It is an expensive strategy and time consuming.&rdquo; (302)</p>

<p><strong>Rebuild</strong>: &ldquo;The existing code will not be used and is discarded. The application is usually re-build[sic] on a Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) stack. Reuilding ensures that capabilities and features of the cloud vendor can be taken into account to gain the full benefit of cloud.&rdquo; (302)</p>

<p><strong>Replace</strong>: &ldquo;The application is discontinued and replaced with a Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) solution. Vendor lock in of the application can be a risk, but is an efficient solution in terms of time and costs.&rdquo; (302)</p>

<h3 id="cost-categories">Cost Categories</h3>

<p>The researchers identified nine cost categories.</p>

<p><strong>Managing Dependencies</strong>:</p>

<p>Eight out of ten banks underbudgeted for managing dependencies during cloud migrations (304). With each dependency the institution must decide if they will migrate all of the services that are interlinked. In this case study there were also instances of the banks not fully comprehending their IT landscape (302).</p>

<p><strong>Legislation</strong>:</p>

<p>Seven out of ten banks underbudgeted on complying with existing regulation. Regulations are often behind the adoption of new technology and when the banks went to implement a new solution they were often required to check with individuals from each locality. Additionally, at least one interviewee expressed intense time and money costs to getting answers to questions like &ldquo;where and how is the data stored&rdquo; from  the cloud provider (304).</p>

<p><strong>Support From Other Departments</strong></p>

<p>Five out of ten banks underbudgeted. One bank had all of their requests filled on a per request basis and thus had no idea on costs. Another slowed the adoption because they lacked the expertise to go through. (305) Security, compliance, and risk are the main departments that will be needed during a cloud migration; however, there are likely other stakeholders across an institution who should be involved and have a relationship with IT departments. According to the authors, the banks that did this, had &ldquo;increased agility and effectiveness&rdquo; (305) with the cloud migration.</p>

<p><strong>Re-architect</strong></p>

<p>Five out of ten banks underbudgeted. The authors note that, &ldquo;during a cloud migration banks are not fully aligned yet with the possibilities offered by the cloud vendor&rdquo; (305). Sometimes it&rsquo;s not possible to re-architect in the cloud due to requirements or the differences between the existing technology and the cloud services themselves (mainframes are still online running Cobol for a reason).</p>

<p><strong>External Contractors</strong></p>

<p>None of the banks spent less than budget on external contractors and 5 of them over spent (306). External contractors are often hired because the internal talent often does not have the knowledge. The other factors that lead to surprising external contractor costs are: a lack of preparation from project management, changing business requirements, and IT employees being told it will happen sooner than is feasible. This latter point can lead to employees moving on to greener pastures and institutions should have a retention plan, else they can end up with new hires that do not know the internal system (306).</p>

<p><strong>Internal Resources</strong></p>

<p>Less banks overspent on this category (4/10). The reason in every case was too much optimism regarding the amount of internal knowledge regarding cloud migrations. Those involved with the migrations noted that the cloud presents a steep learning curve (306).</p>

<p><strong>Cloud Training</strong></p>

<p>Four out of ten banks overspent in this regard. Some under spending was due to a lack of interest from internal staff; however, firms that engaged in training discovered that the knowledge gap was worse than when they began. Whether or not the bank spends money on training resources and if they promote the available training also has an impact on learning outcomes (307). We can infer from this that sustained knowledge gaps will increase cloud costs.</p>

<p><strong>Cloud Migration Core Team</strong></p>

<p>This is an area where only three out of ten banks underbudgeted. The primary reason for increased cost is the complexity of a cloud migration. These banks also noted that because experience with cloud computing is very low in the industry, it requires more personnel than initially imagined (307).</p>

<p><strong>Third Party Services</strong></p>

<p>The authors note that third party services differ from external contractors because the service may manage a process end-to-end. One interviewee mentioned that it was simply too costly to migrate a mainframe application and the return on investment would be negative. Another bank complained of lock-in from an existing vendor. A third party service managed their on-premise environment and the vendor was simply not interested in working on helping them migrate to public cloud (307).  With third party services there always exists the risk of vendor lock-in.</p>

<h3 id="future-reference">Future Reference</h3>

<p>The Technology Business Management Framework (TBM) might be useful to look into as it is a method to align IT and Finance departs and increase the value of IT spending; however, it also is very likely not relevant to where I want to go with this project.</p>

<p>For future projects I am interested in their data collection method (302-303).</p>

<p>The longest paper of the night. Abstract also looks like it&rsquo;ll be the most useful. Here goes.</p>

<p>DOI: 10.14763/2013.4.212 - Source: Internet Policy Review Volume 2 | Issue 4</p>

<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>

<p>The author  details the pitfalls of centralized applications and the consequences this has for end users and then works their way through a host of applications and software being developed by civil society. They then compare the policy implications noting that it is easier for a regulatory body to enforce laws when applications are centralized but end-users experience diminished autonomy. Conversely, in peer-to-peer and other distributed systems, it is much more difficult to regulate and, therefore, easier to break the law.</p>

<h2 id="quotes">Quotes</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Most importantly, the shift from local on-premises operated servers to foreign servers aggregating data from many different sources into a few centralised data centres is likely to decrease the autonomy of users who become more and more dependent on the infrastructure provided by the cloud providers&rdquo; (2)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The author notes and, at this point, we have seen how this reduces user autonomy because &ldquo;cloud operators control the infrastructure of communication, the online applications, as well as all the content or data available on the cloud&rdquo; (2)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;In addition to the obvious concerns that this might entail in terms of data privacy and security (Nelson, 2009), relinquishing control over personal data or information can also undermine users&rsquo; right to information (i.e. users&rsquo; ability to determine, by themselves, how information can and well be used) - a right which Germany has recognised as one of the most important parts of the general right of personality (Allgemeines Persönlichkeitsrecht&rdquo;  (3)</p>

<p>&ldquo;By relying exclusively on the computing resources of individual users&rsquo; devices, it becomes indeed possible to create powerful and dynamic cloud environments which are not controlled by any third party operator, but only and exclusively by the actual members of the community (Marions &amp; Briscoe, 2009). Re0-claiming ownership over the technical infrastructure of the cloud platform allows users to more easily control the manner in which and the extent to which content or data stored in the cloud bill be accessed and subsequently exploited by the community (Wu &amp; al., 2010)&rdquo; (5)</p>

<p>&ldquo;decentralised cloud computing applications might entail higher management costs and greater security risks than their centralised counterparts, mainly  due to the need for coordinating a large number of untrusted and potentially malicious devices (Camp, 2003&rdquo; (5)</p>

<p>&ldquo;Given the regulatory gap that characterises the cloud computing industry and the lack of political interest in filling this gap &ndash; especially in view of the pressure exerted by US government instittuions such as the National Security Agency (NSA), which actually expect online service providers to collect and reveal data from their user-ase &ndash; lobbying and advocacy from civil society is unlikely to result in any practical outcome before a long period of time.&rdquo; (5)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Privacy, security, and resiliency are the foremost reasons to push for a more heterogenous network experience, but I do think the author is correct to point out that there is also diminished user autonomy. Can I find a measure of the effects that diminished autonomy has on democratic society?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;in order to regulate the activities of individual internet users, it is generally much easier for the state to rely on large online intermediaries, such as cloud operators, and delegate them the responsibility to enforce legal norms onto their users (Bartling &amp; Fischbacher, 2012).&rdquo; (5)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In 2021, the US government has effectively abdicated responsiblity for regulating tech and is content to let the public put pressure on large platforms to do a bare minimum of enforcement. AWS, Apple, and Cloudflare have all taken stances against white supremacist applications.</p>

<p>This ended up being a much shorter paper than I thought it would be. It&rsquo;s in like 16 point font for some reason. It contains two quotes that I want to preserve for later.

<p>ISSN: 2380-3312 - Source: Catalyst: feminism, theory, technoscience</p>

<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>

<p>The authors provide a survey of where discussions of technology were going before media and globalizations studies turned optimistic. The authors suggest that by going back and egnaging with the black radical theoretical tradition as well as incorporating indigenous and decolonial critiques we can move beyond the focus of knowledge production and back towards creating a collective imagination.</p>

<h2 id="quotes">Quotes</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;It was through these movements for decolonization and racial and economic justice where we first see calls for self-reliance and ultimately &ldquo;liberated mediat infrastructures to combat colonial propaganda and build transational circuits of transport and communication (radio and newspapers) in the services of the commons (Arough &amp; Chakravartty 2016, p. 563) (2)&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The post-Cold war era of a seemingly peaceful global order alongside the worldwide proliferation of neo-liberal media and computer infrastructure has further shifted the interest in the fields of communication and media studies away from engagement with colonial violence and what political scientist Cedric Robinson termed &ldquo;racial capitalism&rdquo; (1983).

<p>First up in the papers I need to read through today is <em>Municipal Shared Services Cloud</em>. It&rsquo;s a decade old so I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;ll have anything useful but it&rsquo;s a quick read and the title seems relevant.</p>

<p>DOI: 10.1109/SRII.2011.39 - Source: IEEE Xplore</p>

<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>

<p>A case study of 12 NY state municipalities and their needs related to service delivery and how a Municipal Shared Services Cloud could lower costs, deliver services more efficiently, and provide better information sharing capabilities.</p>

<p>The paper goes on to pitch an IBM IaaS/Saas Platform from governments. It seems standard for anyone aware of the IaaS. They propose an open data model so that third parties can provide external services that the government otherwise would not. Specifically, they call upon developers to harness the profit motive and make services that are not in the budget.</p>

<h2 id="quotes">Quotes</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;We discovered that most of the IT applications used to support service delivery for the municipalities we studied aligned directly to the departmental strcuture, with application(s) covering only the tasks associated with a single department&rdquo; (2).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is good to know but seems to be a restatement of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_law">Conway&rsquo;s Law</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;In many cases, the departments all use distinct, non-integrated, custom software programs to aid in their work. &rdquo; (3).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This goes onto explain that across the 8 departments there are 10 different IT systems. Which does seem egregious. Has this gotten better in the intervening decade?</p>

<p>Costs of municipal integrations could be prohibitive leaving municipalities to forgo any advantages of integration. &ldquo;the cost ranged from $8000 to $25,000 per application pair&rdquo; (4).</p>

<h2 id="analysis">Analysis</h2>

<p>The authors presented useful information with regards to how bad data sharing was at the beginning of the last decade and their solution is for public infrastructure to be contracted out to a private company, for a fee. This is not uncommon and follows a common logic that institutions will save money by outsourcing their physical IT infrastructure. Not only will they save money but that their systems will be better for it.</p>

<p>The systems may be better for it but it will still cost money in terms of developers and what I think I need is some data on switching costs and maybe some longitudinal information from institutions that made the switch early.</p>

         	<p>I have spent the better part of my twenties with and around book sellers. Further, I have spent the better part of my twenties at one particular independent bookstore. When I visited recently, they were giving out Danny Caine&rsquo;s How to Resist Amazon and Why as part of independent bookstore day and I knew I had to pick it up.</p>

<p>Amazon has entrenched itself in our daily lives in a variety of ways. This entrenchment actively harms workers, consumers, small businesses, governments, and public goods. While glimpses of these harms surface, it is hard to succinctly capture the broad scope of horrors Amazon imposes on us. Writing through the lens of a bookseller, Danny Caine, captures Amazon&rsquo;s impacts across not only his industry but the landscape of the United States.  Caine covers everything from Amazon’s impact on local economies, their reaction to laborers advocating for better working conditions, their grip on web services, and the downright embarrassing ways that our politicians trip over themselves to stuff Amazon’s coffers with public money, and, of course, independent bookstores.</p>

<p>The text can be read in an afternoon and is worth reading not only get a wider view of the harms an unchecked Amazon imposes, but also for glimpses into what community institutions provide and reminders that a corporation that seeks to render all of the people, labor, and processes behind its offerings invisible can never match what we gain when those same offerings are supported locally within our own communities.</p>

<p>Caine concludes the book by offering simple actions. I will not list every step here, but his most important contribution is making a point on framing. He notes that the use of resistance language is intentional and intentionally separate from boycotting. Ultimately, due to Amazon’s influence across industries, it is all but impossible to boycott the company, but we can find alternatives to the everything store, we can call on our representatives to revitalize anti-trust in the United States, and we can support the workers within Amazon agitating for a better world.</p>

<p>How to Resist Amazon and Why can be ordered through your local bookstore or you can purchase it from <a href="https://www.ravenbookstore.com/book/9781621067061">Raven Book Store directly</a>.</p>

         	<p>Cory Doctorow&rsquo;s newest book wasn&rsquo;t on my radar until I walked into my local bookstore on release day and the clerk handed me copy. Logging into Amazon may have induced as similar experience, but there&rsquo;s something about people applying thought to those in their community that made the experience categorically more pleasant.</p>

<p>I co-run another <a href="https://de-contemporary.com/">project</a> that tackles non-fiction books and presents summaries. I&rsquo;ve been wanting to apply a similar practice used there for my fiction reading. Radicalized is the first fiction book I&rsquo;ve finished in 2019. I&rsquo;m hesitant to call this a review, but I am happy to call these my notes.</p>

<p><em>Radicalized</em>  is a collection of four short stories that grapple with the world we live in today. Appropriately, the back cover of the book reads, &ldquo;Dystopia is now.&rdquo; Their underpinning thematic link is the fact that the world we are building and the world we live in is not necessarily a world to be celebrated.</p>

<p><em>Unauthorized Bread</em> presents us a world where the poorest among us must deal with the impact of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act coupled with integrating software into all of our appliances, how capitalism seeks to always bring things outside of the market into the market, and how those impacted by corporate excesses work together to make workarounds for themselves. Model Minority is the superhero story I&rsquo;ve wanted for so long. Doctorow cribs directly from DC, takes their most well known characters, and makes them reckon with their role in imperialism, the police state, and how, for so long, they&rsquo;ve done nothing to address the injustices that exist within those systems. It&rsquo;s like Doctorow read <a href="https://kotaku.com/spider-mans-take-on-police-feels-out-of-touch-1828978785">Kotaku&rsquo;s review of Marvel&rsquo;s Spider-Man</a> and felt compelled to do address it.</p>

<p><em>Radicalized</em> is arguably about the very subject drawing many Americans to folks to programs like Medicare For All, the American healthcare system. Doctorow couples the existential despair of watching loved ones die, being dragged down by the bureaucratic nightmare of dealing with insurance, and the joys and pitfalls of relying on online communities to cope. The Masque of the Red Death appropriates Edgar Allen Poe&rsquo;s story of the same name and places in the context of a present day apocalypse level catastrophe. Doctorow follows the survivalist prepper mindset to its logical conclusion, but still manages to present how a better world that can be built.</p>

<p>The book can be read in a long afternoon and I would recommend anyone do so for the same reasons I have found myself returning to Doctorow&rsquo;s work since I read <em>Little Brother</em> in high school: He presents versions of the world that exist, or with just a dial turned in any direction, could exist, but his characters do not wallow in despair and the solutions do not come from bootstrapping, mythical individuals. They are about average people who, in the face of dystopia, work together to build a better world.</p>
