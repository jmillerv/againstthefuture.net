				"content_html": "\n\n<p>I don&rsquo;t buy into the Blockchain hype, but I do see the value of decentralization and peer-to-peer (P2P) computing.  That said, this past weekend I went in search of an open-source peer-to-peer relational database. If you are not interested in this journey, I&rsquo;ll tell you now, I did not find decentralized, P2P, relational database.</p>\n\n<p>Relational databases hosted on a central (logical or physical) server make a ton of sense. It&rsquo;s easier to bump performance specs, merge changes without conflicts, there&rsquo;s no need to handle node discovery management, and the list goes on.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"the-web3-offerings\">The Web3 Offerings</h2>\n\n<p>From everything available, web3 promises us another hell of enclosure and private property.  I ended up scouring these fields because the hype cycle and VC money means there&rsquo;s a lot of people whose job is to write software towards the ends of financialized everything under the guise of decentralization. Also, these terms have become so loaded by the web3 people that all search engines lead to blockchain and its relatives.</p>\n\n<p>One protocol, the Interplanetary File System (IPFS), seemed promising. After giving it  a cursory read and concluding that it looked similar to what I wanted (offline first, peer-to-peer storage), I went in search of libraries that utilized this protocol to create a database.</p>\n\n<p>Libraries did exist, but the bulk of them are written in Javascript. That makes sense, considering that many frameworks for web3 were built to onboard as many people as possible as quickly as possible so that numbers go up. That being said, JavaScript is not the first place I&rsquo;d turn to for lower level operations — Javascript wasn&rsquo;t designed for that kind of programming.  My application backend is already being written in Go, so I search for those libraries</p>\n\n<p>Go offerings were present, it&rsquo;s just that everything in the space, especially the Go libraries I found, is an alpha prototype with a void of documentation and light on good examples and tutorials. Sometimes the libraries reference the JavaScript documentation as though it was a 1:1 correlation.</p>\n\n<p>I spent the better part of my Saturday reading documentation, pulling down code, and making test main.go files. The experience wasn&rsquo;t great, it didn&rsquo;t leave me feeling productive, and none of the solutions I found were relational databases.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"content-addressing-systems\">Content Addressing Systems</h3>\n\n<p>The best documented resource was the IPFS itself. It took minimal time to download a binary and have the daemon serving files. The immediate problem with IPFS is that instead of location-based file sharing, it uses a content hash. Rather than ask a computer where it is, you ask what it is. The issue with this is that every time you edit a file, the file (and thus its hash) changes. It would be like if you and your coworker were editing a Google Sheet but instead of merging the changes between the two of you, every change would create a new sheeting.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Important_Sheet</li>\n<li>Important_Sheet1</li>\n<li>Important_Sheet13218931923</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Except content addressing is worse than this because it is all hashes, so, instead imagine every time you make an edit the file name changes, but the names look like the following:</p>\n\n<p><code>fe8df1a5a1980493ca9406ad3bb0e41297d979d90165a181fb39a5616a1c0789</code>\n<code>2f06df38fc91f6c0c35a0bf8d62e92ba32e9a73552523213e55caecd6ece1b24</code></p>\n\n<p><code>9aff1272d57527f40cd54527f72a215b4557f5e8b99b0771ca9a9f22a6f75dd3</code></p>\n\n<p>To the credit of the IPFS developers, they do realize this is a concern and have built a tool to handle the potential to infinitely create new files any time they are changed.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Because files in IPFS are content-addressed and immutable, you can&rsquo;t edit files; instead, a new file is created with every change. The <strong>Mutable File System (MFS)</strong> is a tool built into IPFS that lets you treat files like you normally would in a name-based filesystem — you can add, remove, move, and edit MFS files and have all the work of updating links and hashes taken care of for you. It&rsquo;s an abstraction that lets you deal with immutable data as if it were mutable. (<a href=\"[IPFS Tutorial | Mutable File System (Lesson 1) | ProtoSchool](https://proto.school/mutable-file-system/01)\">Source</a>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In addition to the potential headaches of immutable files —even if abstracted away —I noticed that the web3 folks seem to hate relational data, a requirement.</p>\n\n<p>At this point, I&rsquo;ve wrecked my search history and am I going to get nothing but ads for NFTs because I used all the keywords. Nevertheless, I persisted.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"distributed-sqlite\">Distributed SQLite</h2>\n\n<p>I did find a handful of great libraries during this search, just none of them handled the P2P component.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://litestream.io/\">Litestream</a> provides a great way to replicate an SQLite database, but it can&rsquo;t do bidirectional syncing out of the box and the maintainer rightfully pointed out that you quickly get into the land of <a href=\"[Conflict-free replicated data type - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conflict-free_replicated_data_type)\">conflict-free replicated data types,</a> which pose their own challenges. Not worth it for this endeavor.\n <a href=\"[GitHub - rqlite/rqlite: The lightweight, distributed relational database built on SQLite](https://github.com/rqlite/rqlite)\">rqlite</a> it&rsquo;s a distributed relational database, but there doesn&rsquo;t appear to be mobile support, so I excluded it as a solution.\n <a href=\"[Dqlite - High-Availability SQLite](https://dqlite.io/)\">dqlite</a> I didn&rsquo;t get far enough into reading about all the capabilities, but it looks similar to rqlite, and by this point I&rsquo;ve spent my entire weekend fumbling through different options.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"distributed-and-decentralized-computing-is-hard\">Distributed and Decentralized Computing is Hard</h2>\n\n<p>I did not find an out-of-the-box solution for what I wanted this weekend. What I landed on for this application is just using the free tier of <a href=\"https://www.elephantsql.com/\">ElephantSQL</a> as my backend because there is no good reason to make it P2P nor distributed outside my own interest in computing at the edge. This time, like many other times, Postgres is often the solution.</p>\n\n<p>I did find one proprietary <a href=\"http://litesync.io/en/\">SQLite implementation</a> that supports P2P relational data. The problem is that the free binary limited to one table. At the time of this writing, the paid version was discounted to $750.  If I can think of a single table peer to peer application, I&rsquo;ll give the free binary a whirl.</p>\n",

My application backend is already being written in Go, so I search for those libraries\n\nGo offerings were present, it's just that everything in the space, especially the Go libraries I found, is an alpha prototype with a void of documentation and light on good examples and tutorials. Sometimes the libraries reference the JavaScript documentation as though it was a 1:1 correlation. \n\nI spent the better part of my Saturday reading documentation, pulling down code, and making test main.go files. The experience wasn't great, it didn't leave me feeling productive, and none of the solutions I found were relational databases.\n\n### Content Addressing Systems\n\nThe best documented resource was the IPFS itself. It took minimal time to download a binary and have the daemon serving files. The immediate problem with IPFS is that instead of location-based file sharing, it uses a content hash. Rather than ask a computer where it is, you ask what it is. The issue with this is that every time you edit a file, the file (and thus its hash) changes. It would be like if you and your coworker were editing a Google Sheet but instead of merging the changes between the two of you, every change would create a new sheeting. \n\n- Important_Sheet\n- Important_Sheet1\n- Important_Sheet13218931923\n\nExcept content addressing is worse than this because it is all hashes, so, instead imagine every time you make an edit the file name changes, but the names look like the following: \n\n`fe8df1a5a1980493ca9406ad3bb0e41297d979d90165a181fb39a5616a1c0789`\n`2f06df38fc91f6c0c35a0bf8d62e92ba32e9a73552523213e55caecd6ece1b24` \n\n`9aff1272d57527f40cd54527f72a215b4557f5e8b99b0771ca9a9f22a6f75dd3`\n\nTo the credit of the IPFS developers, they do realize this is a concern and have built a tool to handle the potential to infinitely create new files any time they are changed. \n\n> Because files in IPFS are content-addressed and immutable, you can't edit files; instead, a new file is created with every change. The **Mutable File System (MFS)** is a tool built into IPFS that lets you treat files like you normally would in a name-based filesystem — you can add, remove, move, and edit MFS files and have all the work of updating links and hashes taken care of for you. It's an abstraction that lets you deal with immutable data as if it were mutable. ([Source]([IPFS Tutorial | Mutable File System (Lesson 1) | ProtoSchool](https://proto.school/mutable-file-system/01)))\n\nIn addition to the potential headaches of immutable files —even if abstracted away —I noticed that the web3 folks seem to hate relational data, a requirement.\n\nAt this point, I've wrecked my search history and am I going to get nothing but ads for NFTs because I used all the keywords. Nevertheless, I persisted.  \n\n## Distributed SQLite \n\nI did find a handful of great libraries during this search, just none of them handled the P2P component. \n\n[Litestream](https://litestream.io/) provides a great way to replicate an SQLite database, but it can't do bidirectional syncing out of the box and the maintainer rightfully pointed out that you quickly get into the land of [conflict-free replicated data types,]([Conflict-free replicated data type - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conflict-free_replicated_data_type)) which pose their own challenges. Not worth it for this endeavor. \n [rqlite]([GitHub - rqlite/rqlite: The lightweight, distributed relational database built on SQLite](https://github.com/rqlite/rqlite)) it's a distributed relational database, but there doesn't appear to be mobile support, so I excluded it as a solution. \n [dqlite]([Dqlite - High-Availability SQLite](https://dqlite.io/)) I didn't get far enough into reading about all the capabilities, but it looks similar to rqlite, and by this point I've spent my entire weekend fumbling through different options. \n\n## Distributed and Decentralized Computing is Hard\n\nI did not find an out-of-the-box solution for what I wanted this weekend. What I landed on for this application is just using the free tier of [ElephantSQL](https://www.elephantsql.com/) as my backend because there is no good reason to make it P2P nor distributed outside my own interest in computing at the edge. This time, like many other times, Postgres is often the solution. \n\nI did find one proprietary [SQLite implementation](http://litesync.io/en/) that supports P2P relational data. The problem is that the free binary limited to one table. At the time of this writing, the paid version was discounted to $750.  If I can think of a single table peer to peer application, I'll give the free binary a whirl. \n",

In my personal, arbitrary rating system, these were the books that I gave a 5/5 to.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"a-psalm-for-the-wild-built-by-becky-chambers\">A Psalm for the Wild-Built by Becky Chambers</h2>\n\n<p>This was the first book I read after completing my master&rsquo;s degree, and its dedication appropriately reads, &ldquo;For anyone who could use a break.&rdquo; It stands out as my favorite fiction book of the year because it presents a Luddite vision of the world where a non-violent <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dune_(franchise)#The_Butlerian_Jihad\">Butlerian Jihad</a> took place and the world got better. Each page has something lovely, refreshing, or revelatory.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"the-long-way-to-a-small-angry-planet-by-becky-chambers\">The Long Way to A Small, Angry Planet by Becky Chambers</h2>\n\n<p>If you want an enjoyable space opera by an author who excels at exploring the interiority of both human and non-human creatures, Becky Chambers delivers. This is a great start to her Wayfarer Series.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"is-ai-good-for-the-planet-by-benedetta-brevini\">Is AI Good for the Planet? by Benedetta Brevini</h2>\n\n<p>In about 100 pages, Benedetta Brevini explains how AI is harming the planet. The first two thirds of the book lay the foundations and economics of the current AI hype cycle. The latter third of the book details precisely how our current pursuits of AI will only worsen climate change and bring it about faster. There are plenty of great primers on AI, but if you want a text that covers a brief history that is replete with sources and focuses on climate change, this is a good first text.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"how-to-destroy-surveillance-capitalism-by-cory-doctorow\">How to Destroy Surveillance Capitalism by Cory Doctorow</h2>\n\n<p>How to Destroy Surveillance Capitalism is a book length response to Zuboff’s Surveillance Capitalism: The fight for a Human Future at the New Frontier of Power. Doctorow agrees that we face difficult challenges regarding technology and capitalism, but fears her diagnosis of the problem will lead us down an incorrect path.</p>\n\n<p>Zuboff notes that everything that Big Tech says about itself is probably a lie, but Doctorow points out that she makes one exception: the stated efficacy of Big Tech products. He asks: is it possible that instead of them having products that persuade people to buy things, Big Tech instead has a monopoly over both communications and commerce?</p>\n\n<p>Using a materialist analysis, Doctorow goes on to explore why these monopolies persist and what to do about them. He suggests our primary choices are to either regulate them in such a way that only giant companies could possibly comply, or return to an era of robust antitrust.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"minitel-welcome-to-the-internet-by-julien-mailland-kevin-driscoll\">Minitel: Welcome to the Internet by Julien Mailland &amp; Kevin Driscoll</h2>\n\n<p>Mailland and Driscoll take us through the history of Minitel, France&rsquo;s early internet that preceeded the US system by a decade. While the Minitel system eventually shut down, the history presented is crucial for expanding how we think about the history of our present internet and what it could be.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"post-growth-living-for-an-alternative-hedonism-by-kate-soper\">Post-Growth Living For an Alternative Hedonism by Kate Soper</h2>\n\n<p>Kate Soper challenges the notion that the necessary reductions in consumption needed to address the climate catastrophe need not be a puritanical pleasure denying endeavor. By providing for our more basic needs (food, housing, recreation, etc.) in a way that is sustainably reproduced (sometimes through slower methods), she argues that post-growth living could return to us the pleasures we are currently denied. In order for resource attrition to decline, people, goods, and information must slow down first. Reducing the amount we consume, would reduce the amount we feel we need to work and encourage us to once again participate in the arts of living and relating to one another.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"the-circle-of-the-snake-by-grafton-tanner\">The Circle of the Snake by Grafton Tanner</h2>\n\n<p>In <em>The Circle of the Snake</em> Grafton Tanner takes on nostalgia. He looks at the events that have shaped the first two decades of the 21st century in the United States, namely, 9/11 and the Great Recession, and explores how our current systems have us yearning for a mythical past that never existed and how this yearning hurtles us towards fascism.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"blockchain-chicken-farm-and-other-stories-of-tech-in-china-s-countryside-by-xiaowei-wang\">Blockchain Chicken Farm And Other Stories of Tech in China&rsquo;s Countryside by Xiaowei Wang</h2>\n\n<p>Through evocative prose, family history, and interviews across China, Xiaowei Wang&rsquo;s work highlights the innovations, challenges, impacts, and triumphs of people and their relationship to the technology sphere. From chicken farms, to online pearl parties, to the ideology behind innovation in Shenzen, Wang details each of these stories with clarity and never fails to acknowledge the underlying social, political, or environmental problems that these stories are caught up in.\nThe only other thing to say about this is that Blockchain Chicken Farm is hands down my favorite non-fiction book of the year.</p>\n",

Each page has something lovely, refreshing, or revelatory. \r\n\r\n## The Long Way to A Small, Angry Planet by Becky Chambers\r\n\r\nIf you want an enjoyable space opera by an author who excels at exploring the interiority of both human and non-human creatures, Becky Chambers delivers. This is a great start to her Wayfarer Series. \r\n\r\n## Is AI Good for the Planet? by Benedetta Brevini\r\n\r\nIn about 100 pages, Benedetta Brevini explains how AI is harming the planet. The first two thirds of the book lay the foundations and economics of the current AI hype cycle. The latter third of the book details precisely how our current pursuits of AI will only worsen climate change and bring it about faster. There are plenty of great primers on AI, but if you want a text that covers a brief history that is replete with sources and focuses on climate change, this is a good first text. \r\n\r\n## How to Destroy Surveillance Capitalism by Cory Doctorow\r\n\r\nHow to Destroy Surveillance Capitalism is a book length response to Zuboff’s Surveillance Capitalism: The fight for a Human Future at the New Frontier of Power. Doctorow agrees that we face difficult challenges regarding technology and capitalism, but fears her diagnosis of the problem will lead us down an incorrect path. \r\n\r\nZuboff notes that everything that Big Tech says about itself is probably a lie, but Doctorow points out that she makes one exception: the stated efficacy of Big Tech products. He asks: is it possible that instead of them having products that persuade people to buy things, Big Tech instead has a monopoly over both communications and commerce?\r\n\r\nUsing a materialist analysis, Doctorow goes on to explore why these monopolies persist and what to do about them. He suggests our primary choices are to either regulate them in such a way that only giant companies could possibly comply, or return to an era of robust antitrust.\r\n\r\n## Minitel: Welcome to the Internet by Julien Mailland & Kevin Driscoll \r\n\r\nMailland and Driscoll take us through the history of Minitel, France's early internet that preceeded the US system by a decade. While the Minitel system eventually shut down, the history presented is crucial for expanding how we think about the history of our present internet and what it could be. \r\n \r\n## Post-Growth Living For an Alternative Hedonism by Kate Soper\r\n\r\nKate Soper challenges the notion that the necessary reductions in consumption needed to address the climate catastrophe need not be a puritanical pleasure denying endeavor. By providing for our more basic needs (food, housing, recreation, etc.) in a way that is sustainably reproduced (sometimes through slower methods), she argues that post-growth living could return to us the pleasures we are currently denied. In order for resource attrition to decline, people, goods, and information must slow down first. Reducing the amount we consume, would reduce the amount we feel we need to work and encourage us to once again participate in the arts of living and relating to one another. \r\n\r\n## The Circle of the Snake by Grafton Tanner\r\n\r\nIn *The Circle of the Snake* Grafton Tanner takes on nostalgia. He looks at the events that have shaped the first two decades of the 21st century in the United States, namely, 9/11 and the Great Recession, and explores how our current systems have us yearning for a mythical past that never existed and how this yearning hurtles us towards fascism. \r\n\r\n## Blockchain Chicken Farm And Other Stories of Tech in China's Countryside by Xiaowei Wang\r\n\r\nThrough evocative prose, family history, and interviews across China, Xiaowei Wang's work highlights the innovations, challenges, impacts, and triumphs of people and their relationship to the technology sphere. From chicken farms, to online pearl parties, to the ideology behind innovation in Shenzen, Wang details each of these stories with clarity and never fails to acknowledge the underlying social, political, or environmental problems that these stories are caught up in. \r\nThe only other thing to say about this is that Blockchain Chicken Farm is hands down my favorite non-fiction book of the year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

				"title": "Notes | How to Destroy Surveillance Capitalism",
				"content_html": "\n\n<h2 id=\"summary\">Summary</h2>\n\n<p><em>How to Destroy Surveillance Capitalism</em> is a book length response to Zuboff&rsquo;s <em>Surveillance Capitalism: The fight for a Human Future at the New Frontier of Power</em>. Doctorow agrees that we face difficult challenges regarding technology and capitalism, but fears her diagnosis of the problem will lead us down an incorrect path.</p>\n\n<p>Zuboff notes that everything that Big Tech says about itself is probably a lie, but Doctorow points out that she makes one exception: the stated efficacy of Big Tech products. He asks: is it possible that instead of them having products that persuade people to buy things, Big Tech instead has a monopoly over both communications and commerce?</p>\n\n<p>Using a materialist analysis, Doctorow goes on to explore why these monopolies persist and what to do about them. He suggests our primary choices are to either regulate them in such a way that only giant companies could possibly comply or return to an era of robust antitrust.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"quotes-and-observations\">Quotes and Observations</h2>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>&ldquo;What if it&rsquo;s the material circumstances, and not the arguments, that are making the difference for these conspiracy pitchmen? What if the traum of living through <em>real conspiracies</em> all around us &ndash; conspiracies among wealthy people, their lobbyists and lawmakers to bury inconvenient facts and evidence of wrongdoing (these conspiracies are commonly known as &ldquo;corruption&rdquo;)&ndash; is making people vulnerable to conspiracy theories?&rdquo; (4)</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Figuring out what we want our tech to look like is crucial if we&rsquo;re going to get out of this mess. Today, we&rsquo;re at a crossroads where we&rsquo;re trying to figure out if we want to fix the Big Tech companies that dominate our internet or if we want to fix the internet itself by unshackling it from Big Tech&rsquo;s stranglehold. We can&rsquo;t do both, so we have to choose.&rdquo; (5)</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;The fear of surveillance capitalism starts from the (correct) presumption that everything Big Tech says about itself is probably a lie. But the surveillance capitalism critique makes an exception for the claims Big Tech makes in its sales literature&ndash;the breathless hype in the pitches to potential advertisers online and in ad-tech seminars about the efficacy of its products: It assumes that Big Tech is as good at influencing us as they claim they are when they&rsquo;re selling influencing products to credulous customers. That&rsquo;s a mistake because sales literature is not a reliable indicator of a product&rsquo;s efficacy.&rdquo; (11)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Segmenting (13) When you can split people into groups that are already likely to agree with you, you may be able to get them to agree with you, but this is not persuasion, and it&rsquo;s certainly not mind control.

				"content_text": "## Summary \n\n*How to Destroy Surveillance Capitalism* is a book length response to Zuboff's *Surveillance Capitalism: The fight for a Human Future at the New Frontier of Power*. Doctorow agrees that we face difficult challenges regarding technology and capitalism, but fears her diagnosis of the problem will lead us down an incorrect path.  \n\nZuboff notes that everything that Big Tech says about itself is probably a lie, but Doctorow points out that she makes one exception: the stated efficacy of Big Tech products. He asks: is it possible that instead of them having products that persuade people to buy things, Big Tech instead has a monopoly over both communications and commerce?    \n\nUsing a materialist analysis, Doctorow goes on to explore why these monopolies persist and what to do about them. He suggests our primary choices are to either regulate them in such a way that only giant companies could possibly comply or return to an era of robust antitrust. \n\n\n\n## Quotes and Observations   \n\n> \"What if it's the material circumstances, and not the arguments, that are making the difference for these conspiracy pitchmen? What if the traum of living through *real conspiracies* all around us -- conspiracies among wealthy people, their lobbyists and lawmakers to bury inconvenient facts and evidence of wrongdoing (these conspiracies are commonly known as \"corruption\")-- is making people vulnerable to conspiracy theories?\" (4)\n\n>  \"Figuring out what we want our tech to look like is crucial if we're going to get out of this mess. Today, we're at a crossroads where we're trying to figure out if we want to fix the Big Tech companies that dominate our internet or if we want to fix the internet itself by unshackling it from Big Tech's stranglehold. We can't do both, so we have to choose.\" (5) \n\n> \"The fear of surveillance capitalism starts from the (correct) presumption that everything Big Tech says about itself is probably a lie. But the surveillance capitalism critique makes an exception for the claims Big Tech makes in its sales literature--the breathless hype in the pitches to potential advertisers online and in ad-tech seminars about the efficacy of its products: It assumes that Big Tech is as good at influencing us as they claim they are when they're selling influencing products to credulous customers. That's a mistake because sales literature is not a reliable indicator of a product's efficacy.\" (11) \n\nSegmenting (13) When you can split people into groups that are already likely to agree with you, you may be able to get them to agree with you, but this is not persuasion, and it's certainly not mind control.  The following quote might be one of the better explanations that explains the prominence of crypto.\n\nDomination (17)\n\n> \"Surveillance capitalism also abets fraud by making it easy to locate other people who have been similarly deceived, forming a community of people who reinforce one another's false beliefs. Think of the forums in which people who are being victimized by multilevel marketing frauds gather to trade tips on how to improve their luck in peddling the product.\" (16) \n\n>  \"One example of how monopolism aids in persuasion is through dominance: Google makes editorial decisions about its algorithms that determine the sort order of the responses to our queries. If a cabal of fraudsters have set out ot trick the world into thinking that the Brooklyn Bridge is 5,800 feet long, and if Google gives a high search rank to this group in response to queries like \"How long is the Brooklyn Bridge?\" then the first 8 or 10 screens' worth of Google results could be wrong.\" He goes on to not that since few people look beyond the first page of results, many people will end up being deceived.

(30)\n\nI would argue that Apple's products have done the same, and there's even leaked correspondence from Apple citing iMessage as a way to keep users locked in.\n\nTo create \"organic traffic\" Facebook must insert incendiary content to gin up controversy to show activity on the platform, to better sell ads (34).

There are a few valid use cases for append-only ledgers; however, most people working on a project will find simpler methods for distributing their system, ensuring its security, and trusting those that they work with rather.  \n\n## Further Reading \n[Merkle Tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merkle_tree)  \n[Public Key Cryptography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-key_cryptography#Public_key_infrastructure)\n\n## Links  \n[Plugin to help understand blockchain](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/replace-blockchain-with-s/johdgapbhomlhcflancninpeafocpopn?hl=en-US)  \n\n",

				"content_html": "\n\n<p>DOI 10.1016/j.compcom.2010.06.006 | Author Annette Vee | Date 2010</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"summary\">Summary</h2>\n\n<p>Dr. Annette Vee looks at the relationship between writing and the encroachment of patent law into the domain of writing (traditionally writing is the domain of copyright law). She examines the arguments from both programmers and legal scholars as to why patents are a poor regime for code by pointing to the fact that creation is more akin to traditional writing endeavors than engineering or manufacturing. Additionally Vee looks to instances where, rather that spur innovation, patent law actively prohibits it. With large swathes of the population able to write code and much of today&rsquo;s acitivities being mediated through software she argues that patent law is no longer fit for the contexts of code composition.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"quotes-and-observations\">Quotes and Observations</h2>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Copyright law pays attention to the composition process behind a work of authorship whereas patent law does not. To prove copyright infringement, a rights holder must demonstrate that at some point during composition the accused actually copied the copyrighted work.&rdquo; (183)</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;The conditions of novelty and nonobviousness have been poorly applied to software patents in particular, in part because the patent examiner&rsquo;s manual does not suggest a review of prior art located in software.&rdquo; (183)</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Controversies surrounding software patents began as early as the 1960s, when technologies were developing so quickly that President Johnson put together a special commission to review the USPTO’s policies and methods. The Commission, made up of academics, scientists, and industry representatives, recommended in its 1966 report that legislation be introduced to expressly exempt computer programs as patentable subject matter (Samuelson, 1990). No such legislation was passed; however, the USPTO examiner’s guide indicated that computer programs were not patentable under either the “process” or “machine” category described in 35 U.S.C. §101 (Samuelson, 1990). Two Supreme Court rulings in the 1970s affirmed the idea that computer programs were unpatentable; decisions in Gottschalk v. Benson (1972) and Parker v. Flook (1978) both indicated that the algorithms under review were not far enough removed from pure math to make them patentable.&rdquo; (184)</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;The CAFC ruling In Re Alappat (1994) indicated that simply using the terminology of “machine”\nrenders the invention a physical device. The CAFC decision that finally opened the floodgates on software patents was State Street Bank and Trust v. Signature Financial Group (1998), which unambiguously confirmed that an algorithm run by a computer—that is, software—was patentable, as long as it was useful. &ldquo; (184)</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;The fact that many working programmers do not want the protection that patents give them should be a critical sign that something is wrong with the system.&rdquo; (185)</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Prior art for software could be located in manuals academic papers, the Internet, closed-code proprietary software, in-house business programs, and even people&rsquo;s home computers&ndash;in other words, too many places to be feasibly searched.&rdquo; (186)</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;The histories of writing and math both yield a number of resource-poor writers and\nmathematicians such as Frederick Douglass, the writer, or Srinivasa Ramanujan, the self-taught mathematician, who were able to practice their skill to the great benefit of society. Patent law now throws obstacles in the way of the future Douglasses and Ramanujans of programming because it posits the context of software writing to be like engineering or chemistry, with high-investment costs and centralized publishing venues. However, as code literacy becomes more widespread and decentralized, the compositional context for computer code becomes more akin to writing than engineering.  &ldquo; (187)</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;The organization of open-source projects is generally loose, and like Laughlin the independent programmer, open source organizations or individual programmers lack the resources of lawyers and capital that are required to file for patents. Proof of prior art may be in the code, but if it is not in case law or in writing, it is less accessible for the purposes of legal defense. &rdquo; (189)</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Code has become infrastructural to the way we compose and, indeed, to the very way that we live our lives.

				"content_text": "DOI 10.1016/j.compcom.2010.06.006 | Author Annette Vee | Date 2010\n\n## Summary\n\nDr. Annette Vee looks at the relationship between writing and the encroachment of patent law into the domain of writing (traditionally writing is the domain of copyright law). She examines the arguments from both programmers and legal scholars as to why patents are a poor regime for code by pointing to the fact that creation is more akin to traditional writing endeavors than engineering or manufacturing. Additionally Vee looks to instances where, rather that spur innovation, patent law actively prohibits it. With large swathes of the population able to write code and much of today's acitivities being mediated through software she argues that patent law is no longer fit for the contexts of code composition. \n\n## Quotes and Observations\n\n\"Copyright law pays attention to the composition process behind a work of authorship whereas patent law does not. To prove copyright infringement, a rights holder must demonstrate that at some point during composition the accused actually copied the copyrighted work.\" (183)\n\n\"The conditions of novelty and nonobviousness have been poorly applied to software patents in particular, in part because the patent examiner's manual does not suggest a review of prior art located in software.\" (183)\n\n\"Controversies surrounding software patents began as early as the 1960s, when technologies were developing so quickly that President Johnson put together a special commission to review the USPTO’s policies and methods. The Commission, made up of academics, scientists, and industry representatives, recommended in its 1966 report that legislation be introduced to expressly exempt computer programs as patentable subject matter (Samuelson, 1990). No such legislation was passed; however, the USPTO examiner’s guide indicated that computer programs were not patentable under either the “process” or “machine” category described in 35 U.S.C. §101 (Samuelson, 1990). Two Supreme Court rulings in the 1970s affirmed the idea that computer programs were unpatentable; decisions in Gottschalk v. Benson (1972) and Parker v. Flook (1978) both indicated that the algorithms under review were not far enough removed from pure math to make them patentable.\" (184)\n\n\"The CAFC ruling In Re Alappat (1994) indicated that simply using the terminology of “machine”\nrenders the invention a physical device. The CAFC decision that finally opened the floodgates on software patents was State Street Bank and Trust v. Signature Financial Group (1998), which unambiguously confirmed that an algorithm run by a computer—that is, software—was patentable, as long as it was useful. \" (184)\n\n\"The fact that many working programmers do not want the protection that patents give them should be a critical sign that something is wrong with the system.\" (185)\n\n\"Prior art for software could be located in manuals academic papers, the Internet, closed-code proprietary software, in-house business programs, and even people's home computers--in other words, too many places to be feasibly searched.\" (186)\n\n\"The histories of writing and math both yield a number of resource-poor writers and\nmathematicians such as Frederick Douglass, the writer, or Srinivasa Ramanujan, the self-taught mathematician, who were able to practice their skill to the great benefit of society. Patent law now throws obstacles in the way of the future Douglasses and Ramanujans of programming because it posits the context of software writing to be like engineering or chemistry, with high-investment costs and centralized publishing venues. However, as code literacy becomes more widespread and decentralized, the compositional context for computer code becomes more akin to writing than engineering.  \" (187)\n\n\"The organization of open-source projects is generally loose, and like Laughlin the independent programmer, open source organizations or individual programmers lack the resources of lawyers and capital that are required to file for patents. Proof of prior art may be in the code, but if it is not in case law or in writing, it is less accessible for the purposes of legal defense. \" (189)\n\n\"Code has become infrastructural to the way we compose and, indeed, to the very way that we live our lives. Software mediates almost all of our financial transactions, our communications, and our information outlets and inlets. Behind each program are millions of lines of code written by thousands of professional and hobbyist programmers in hundreds of different languages. Because patent law is nearly impossible for non-specialists to take advantage of or even interpret, it does not mesh well with a decentralized\ncomposition scenario.\" (190)\n\n## References to Read \n\nGurak, Laura.

I sit in the camp for as long as I can but the flickering light of the candelabra and the dull throb of my ankle aren&rsquo;t the best company. I pull out the map and study it. The encounter with the gargoyle has me considering returning home but it&rsquo;s then I remember that there is nothing  athome. I took the map because it&rsquo;s all that was left in the ruins. Crossing this stupid sea and following this heirloom map won&rsquo;t bring anyone back or re-unite me with them, but trodding this path will make me feel closer to my my family. My village.</p>\n\n<p>Staring at the map fails to give me any new insights. I take out the map Hugo gave me and it&rsquo;s too much new information to take in. Forward motion is the only thing I think I can focus on right now. Where is Hugo? It&rsquo;s been half a day. We need to be getting on. I&rsquo;m not sure this island can even sustain us for much longer and I have enough provisions to cross the sea and get to town for one, but I&rsquo;m not going to let Hugo starve. At this point he&rsquo;s saved my life more than me getting him off this island would save his.</p>\n\n<p>I make my way to our lean-to and lay down. I don&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;ll be leaving today and the events of the last two days have me more drained than I was planning on being this early in the journey. I close my eyes but it&rsquo;s too humid to simply drift away. Eventually, I am able to force myself to sleep.</p>\n\n<p>In the distance I hear something being dragged and some heavy huffing. &ldquo;Hugo,&rdquo; I call out. More huffing. I stand uneasy and limp out of the lean-to. Hugo is dragging something..</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry yourself,&rdquo; Hugo says as I move closer,  &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll put weight on your bad leg if you help.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;What is this?&rdquo; I ask. I could see that it was some sort of chest but I wanted to hear how he left with a jeweled cane handle and came back with this. I notice the handle resting on a belt he fashioned out of string I gave him from my provisions.</p>\n\n<p>He inhales, &ldquo;Well, you won&rsquo;t believe it but I went in search of a fine piece of wood to carve your cane out of.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;You left this morning! What took so long?&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t mean to worry you. It&rsquo;s just when I was looking for the perfect piece of wood I went towards the middle of the isle, figuring the trees would be older, sturdier, have more options. You know?&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>I wasn&rsquo;t sure where this was going, &ldquo;And?&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m at this tree because I haven&rsquo;t found anything good on the ground. I figured I&rsquo;d just take something and dry it out. I mean we&rsquo;ll be rowing and just baking under the candelabra. Probably can dry out right quick. You know?&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; I say.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;And with us taking turns rowing&hellip;&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;I get it,&rdquo; I cut him off, a day of waiting has left me impatient, &ldquo;You&rsquo;d have time to work on carving it.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Yes. So, I&rsquo;m in front of this tree and I&rsquo;m about to climb it. But something&rsquo;s not right,&rdquo; he pauses with an annoying dramatic flair, &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a bump in the ground.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Seems perfectly normal to me,&rdquo; I say.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s where you and I view the world differently. Been around long enough to know trees. These here on the isles don&rsquo;t root like mainland trees. Shouldn&rsquo;t be weird bulges.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Okay.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;So, I start digging.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;You start digging? Based on what?&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>He pauses and looks into my eyes,&ldquo;The bulge &ndash; something&rsquo;s not right.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>I&rsquo;m not sure if it was how he said it or taking the effort to lock his gaze with mine but something about that statement unnerved me, &ldquo;I think I have to take your word for it on this one.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;You do, because I was right,&rdquo; he gestures to the chest, &ldquo;I found some pirate treasure.&rdquo; He smiles.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Pirate treasure?&ldquo;I smirk.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Yep. Just like yer handle. Has to be a pirate.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Why haven&rsquo;t you opened it?&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Locked. I figure you might be able to do something.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;What am I going to do with a locked chest?&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>He smiles, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t play with me here. I&rsquo;ve seen the runes in your journal. I watched you not only survive a gargoyle attack, but a fall from near the rafters. There&rsquo;s a magic coursing through you. Maybe you&rsquo;re not very good with it, but you have it&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Hugo&rsquo;s not wrong. I&rsquo;ve had an affinity for the same magic that powers the Rooks since I was a child. Never terribly controlled and only since adulthood have I been able to muster any control over it. I didn&rsquo;t survive the fall with magic though. Or at least not a single spell came to mind as I watched what was surely my death rapidly approaching.  &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never worked a lock with magic,&rdquo; I tell him.</p>\n\n<p>His eyes widened as though I wasn&rsquo;t understanding his intent, &ldquo;Must you be gentle with it?&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>I could see that he wasn&rsquo;t going to relent on this one. &ldquo;Move it where I can sit in front of it more comfortably.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>We get the chest in a position where I can kneel in front of it. There&rsquo;s a keyhole, metal. The rest of it is made of a heavy wood. I can work with this. I touch two fingers to the keyhole and begin reciting one of the earliest incantations I learned. I raise my other hand to the sky palm out. I don&rsquo;t need much I just need the ambient static from the air. Inhaling and exhaling I can feel the electricity dancing on my palm. I concentrate and let it gather. Finally, I pull it through my body, focus the energy, and loose the concentrated electricity through my fingertips and into the key hole. The wood cracks from the force of the enrgy but the lock becomes a molten mass and begins oozing down the chest.</p>\n\n<p>I exhale and stand. My legs went numb from kneeling and the letting electricity flow through my body always leaves me drained even though it&rsquo;s not shocking me or, maybe, I&rsquo;m somehow inured to it. Either way it&rsquo;s exhausting. &ldquo;Have at it,&rdquo; I say to Hugo.</p>\n\n<p>I sit in the sand and Hugo opens the chest. He&rsquo;s more confused than anything. I watch as he reaches in and pulls out the treasure. It looks like a simple pair of women&rsquo;s boots.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Must have been a lady pirate,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;Are they your size?&rdquo; Hugo hands me the boots. The leather-work is excellent but more than that at the ankles there is an insignia of some kind. Maybe it&rsquo;s from the shoemaker, that would make sense. I study the insignia and realize that it&rsquo;s a rune. A strange dialect of the runic language. Old. Maybe even ancient. The rune doesn&rsquo;t look like anything to avoid.

				"content_html": "\n\n<p>Source: <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1145/3342194\">doi.org/10.1145/3&hellip;</a> | Author(s): John Gastil, Todd Davies | Date: January 2020</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"summary\">Summary</h2>\n\n<p>The authors divide the stages of online deliberations into four eras. They then note that while the current era, Social Media, has, on its face, the most potential for democratic engagement the system is held captive by the power of these platforms and that they are for profit institutions that have no regard for their impact on democracy. Their solution suggests we take from the history of broadcasting and making something like the Corporation for Public Broadcasting for software, a Corporation for Public Software.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"quotes-and-observations\">Quotes and Observations</h2>\n\n<p>The authors divide online deliberation into four stages.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<ol>\n<li>Early Visions of Electronic Democracy (~19070s - 1980s)</li>\n<li>Public Internet (~1990s - early 2000s)</li>\n<li>Social Media (~mid 2000s - present)</li>\n<li>Public Software Stage (2)</li>\n</ol>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The fourth stage is where they layout their vision for a future of technology &amp; digital democracy</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Theorists of this more advanced era of digital technology have hoped that it might restore our depleted social capital by expanding social networks and rebuilding citizens’ trust in each other and their shared institutions [Wells 2015]&rdquo; (2)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Is there any evidence that social media has done anything to build or rebuild trust in shared institutions? Definitely optimistic but is it rooted in reality?</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>&ldquo;The social media platforms most widely used in Stage 3, however, are commercial services built and maintained by private corporations under a profit motive that is often at odds with users’ desires for privacy. At best, commercial social media tools such as Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter are built neither to help nor harm democratic engagement. Instead, a need for continuous advertising revenue drives their design—irrespective of what that means for democracy [McNamee 2019; Wu 2017].&rdquo; (2)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The authors also point out after this quote that the data dominance and the software patents held by these platforms prevents the entry of new tools, including non-commercial options.</p>\n\n<p>In part 2 of the paper the authors assess the present social media landscape.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>&ldquo;Market forces brought this reality into existence [O’Neil 2017], but deeper\nproblems in American democracy made our system vulnerable to manipulation and degradation long before the era of Social Media. &ldquo; (4)</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;There is halting movement toward building a more deliberative and democratic digital commons [Noveck 2018], but these efforts lack coordination and push against powerful obstacles [Howard 2015].  &ldquo; (4)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It seems that better anti-harassments tools, reigning in recommendation algorithms, and introducing friction that encourages critical engagement would be a top priority for creating a democratic digital commons.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>&ldquo;The world ended up using Facebook not because Zuckerberg decided users should do so but because users decided, collectively and one by one, to use Zuckerberg’s platform rather than dozens of alternatives. If Zuckerberg is guilty of crimes against democracy, then he has had 2.5 billion accomplices—the people around the globe who accepted Facebook’s terms of service and posted their data on its site. &rdquo; (5)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Ignores the aggressive advertising and getting people to sign up and the difficulty of leaving Facebook due to a lack of interoperability and lock-in effects generated by much of civic life consolidating onto platforms that Facebook either built or purchased. But sure 2.5 billion people who accepted a contract of adherence are also responsible for the genocide in Myanmar, January 6th, and the nefarious ad surveillance technology they created simply because they were offered a service to use with their friends.</p>\n\n<p>The authors are not opposed to regulation nor anti-trust enforcement but they believe the biggest issue is the lack of ambition in the scope and design of civic reforms (5).</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>&ldquo;To those doubtful of the prospects for digital democratic reform, we point toward the example of Spain [Noveck 2018; Peña-López 2017; Smith 2018]. Barcelona and other municipalities adopted the open source software Consul (developed by a distributed team of programmers led by the San Francisco–headquartered firm HashiCorp) to create civic engagement opportunities. &ldquo; (6)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Should democratic tech orgs for other countries be situated in the US?  I need to go read about HashiCorp now.</p>\n\n<p>They examine a tool called the <em>Platform for Online Deliberation</em> that was eventually renamed to <em>Deme</em>. It had the four following design principles:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>Supportiveness. The platform should support the group overall so that there is either an improvement or no decline in the ability of the group to meet the needs of its members or stakeholders.</li>\n<li>Comprehensiveness. The platform should allow the group to accomplish, in an online environment, all of the usual deliberative tasks associated with face-to-face meetings.</li>\n<li>Participation. The platform should maximize the number of desired participants in the group’s deliberations and minimize barriers to their participation.</li>\n<li>Quality. The platform should facilitate a subjective quality of interaction and decision making that meets or exceeds what the group achieves in face-to-face meetings.  (8)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>&ldquo;The Web environment has become very complex, with security threats and patent infringement high on the list of challenges that were off the radar 16 years ago. One option is to throw up our hands and leave it to the commercial market to create what we need. If we do that, we are likely to get something more useful for asynchronous online deliberation than we have today, and in fact there are now widely used tools that do at least part of what Deme envisioned in 2003 (e.g., Google Docs, Discord, Loomio, and Nextdoor—all but Loomio are proprietary)  &rdquo; (9)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The market hasn&rsquo;t created what we need yet.

				"content_text": "Source: [doi.org/10.1145/3...](https://doi.org/10.1145/3342194) | Author(s): John Gastil, Todd Davies | Date: January 2020\n\n## Summary \n\nThe authors divide the stages of online deliberations into four eras. They then note that while the current era, Social Media, has, on its face, the most potential for democratic engagement the system is held captive by the power of these platforms and that they are for profit institutions that have no regard for their impact on democracy. Their solution suggests we take from the history of broadcasting and making something like the Corporation for Public Broadcasting for software, a Corporation for Public Software. \n\n## Quotes and Observations \n\nThe authors divide online deliberation into four stages. \n\n> 1. Early Visions of Electronic Democracy (~19070s - 1980s)\n> 2. Public Internet (~1990s - early 2000s)\n> 3. Social Media (~mid 2000s - present)\n> 4. Public Software Stage (2)\n\nThe fourth stage is where they layout their vision for a future of technology & digital democracy\n\n> Theorists of this more advanced era of digital technology have hoped that it might restore our depleted social capital by expanding social networks and rebuilding citizens’ trust in each other and their shared institutions [Wells 2015]\" (2)\n\nIs there any evidence that social media has done anything to build or rebuild trust in shared institutions? Definitely optimistic but is it rooted in reality?\n\n>  \"The social media platforms most widely used in Stage 3, however, are commercial services built and maintained by private corporations under a profit motive that is often at odds with users’ desires for privacy. At best, commercial social media tools such as Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter are built neither to help nor harm democratic engagement. Instead, a need for continuous advertising revenue drives their design—irrespective of what that means for democracy [McNamee 2019; Wu 2017].\" (2)\n\nThe authors also point out after this quote that the data dominance and the software patents held by these platforms prevents the entry of new tools, including non-commercial options. \n\nIn part 2 of the paper the authors assess the present social media landscape. \n\n>  \"Market forces brought this reality into existence [O’Neil 2017], but deeper\n> problems in American democracy made our system vulnerable to manipulation and degradation long before the era of Social Media. \" (4)\n\n> \"There is halting movement toward building a more deliberative and democratic digital commons [Noveck 2018], but these efforts lack coordination and push against powerful obstacles [Howard 2015].  \" (4)\n\nIt seems that better anti-harassments tools, reigning in recommendation algorithms, and introducing friction that encourages critical engagement would be a top priority for creating a democratic digital commons. \n\n> \"The world ended up using Facebook not because Zuckerberg decided users should do so but because users decided, collectively and one by one, to use Zuckerberg’s platform rather than dozens of alternatives. If Zuckerberg is guilty of crimes against democracy, then he has had 2.5 billion accomplices—the people around the globe who accepted Facebook’s terms of service and posted their data on its site. \" (5)\n\nIgnores the aggressive advertising and getting people to sign up and the difficulty of leaving Facebook due to a lack of interoperability and lock-in effects generated by much of civic life consolidating onto platforms that Facebook either built or purchased. But sure 2.5 billion people who accepted a contract of adherence are also responsible for the genocide in Myanmar, January 6th, and the nefarious ad surveillance technology they created simply because they were offered a service to use with their friends. \n\nThe authors are not opposed to regulation nor anti-trust enforcement but they believe the biggest issue is the lack of ambition in the scope and design of civic reforms (5). \n\n> \"To those doubtful of the prospects for digital democratic reform, we point toward the example of Spain [Noveck 2018; Peña-López 2017; Smith 2018]. Barcelona and other municipalities adopted the open source software Consul (developed by a distributed team of programmers led by the San Francisco–headquartered firm HashiCorp) to create civic engagement opportunities. \" (6)\n\nShould democratic tech orgs for other countries be situated in the US?  I need to go read about HashiCorp now. \n\nThey examine a tool called the *Platform for Online Deliberation* that was eventually renamed to *Deme*. It had the four following design principles: \n\n> * Supportiveness. The platform should support the group overall so that there is either an improvement or no decline in the ability of the group to meet the needs of its members or stakeholders.\n> *  Comprehensiveness. The platform should allow the group to accomplish, in an online environment, all of the usual deliberative tasks associated with face-to-face meetings.\n> * Participation. The platform should maximize the number of desired participants in the group’s deliberations and minimize barriers to their participation.\n> * Quality. The platform should facilitate a subjective quality of interaction and decision making that meets or exceeds what the group achieves in face-to-face meetings.  (8)\n\n> \"The Web environment has become very complex, with security threats and patent infringement high on the list of challenges that were off the radar 16 years ago. One option is to throw up our hands and leave it to the commercial market to create what we need. If we do that, we are likely to get something more useful for asynchronous online deliberation than we have today, and in fact there are now widely used tools that do at least part of what Deme envisioned in 2003 (e.g., Google Docs, Discord, Loomio, and Nextdoor—all but Loomio are proprietary)  \" (9)\n\nThe market hasn't created what we need yet. Also, are we really going to throw in Nextdoor as a positive example. It's a system that preys on the fears of people and has a [documented problem](https://www.theverge.com/21283993/nextdoor-app-racism-community-moderation-guidance-protests) with its users being racist. \n\n## References to Read \n\n[CONSUL (consulproject.org)](https://consulproject.org/en/)  \n[HashiCor](https://www.hashicorp.com/)  \n\n## Works Cited \n\nMakena Kelly, “Inside Nextdoor’s ‘Karen Problem,’” *The Verge*, last modified June 8, 2020, accessed September 26, 2021, [www.theverge.com/21283993/...](https://www.theverge.com/21283993/nextdoor-app-racism-community-moderation-guidance-protests.)\n",

Even though arms were beginning to fail me I was propelled by a towerjutting out from the land. I could barely make out a figure standing looking out from the tower &ndash; whatever stood theredidn&rsquo;t look human. While I don&rsquo;t have much to lose but this is the beginning of the journey and I&rsquo;m not trying to die on the Deadwe. I continued rowing and rowing and rowing. Eventually, I came upon a island populated with trees. The candelabra was already dimming. I needed to work quickly to have a shelter before nightfall. I dragged the boat into the trees hoping to use it as a lean-to.</p>\n\n<p>As I was setting up camp I noticed smoke plumes rising not too far away. It looked controlled, like an ordinary camp fire.

Even though arms were beginning to fail me I was propelled by a towerjutting out from the land. I could barely make out a figure standing looking out from the tower -- whatever stood theredidn't look human. While I don't have much to lose but this is the beginning of the journey and I'm not trying to die on the Deadwe. I continued rowing and rowing and rowing. Eventually, I came upon a island populated with trees. The candelabra was already dimming. I needed to work quickly to have a shelter before nightfall. I dragged the boat into the trees hoping to use it as a lean-to. \n\nAs I was setting up camp I noticed smoke plumes rising not too far away. It looked controlled, like an ordinary camp fire.

				"content_html": "<p>Cory Doctorow&rsquo;s newest book wasn&rsquo;t on my radar until I walked into my local bookstore on release day and the clerk handed me copy. Logging into Amazon may have induced as similar experience, but there&rsquo;s something about people applying thought to those in their community that made the experience categorically more pleasant.</p>\n\n<p>I co-run another <a href=\"https://de-contemporary.com/\">project</a> that tackles non-fiction books and presents summaries. I&rsquo;ve been wanting to apply a similar practice used there for my fiction reading. Radicalized is the first fiction book I&rsquo;ve finished in 2019. I&rsquo;m hesitant to call this a review, but I am happy to call these my notes.</p>\n\n<p><em>Radicalized</em>  is a collection of four short stories that grapple with the world we live in today. Appropriately, the back cover of the book reads, &ldquo;Dystopia is now.&rdquo; Their underpinning thematic link is the fact that the world we are building and the world we live in is not necessarily a world to be celebrated.</p>\n\n<p><em>Unauthorized Bread</em> presents us a world where the poorest among us must deal with the impact of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act coupled with integrating software into all of our appliances, how capitalism seeks to always bring things outside of the market into the market, and how those impacted by corporate excesses work together to make workarounds for themselves. Model Minority is the superhero story I&rsquo;ve wanted for so long. Doctorow cribs directly from DC, takes their most well known characters, and makes them reckon with their role in imperialism, the police state, and how, for so long, they&rsquo;ve done nothing to address the injustices that exist within those systems. It&rsquo;s like Doctorow read <a href=\"https://kotaku.com/spider-mans-take-on-police-feels-out-of-touch-1828978785\">Kotaku&rsquo;s review of Marvel&rsquo;s Spider-Man</a> and felt compelled to do address it.</p>\n\n<p><em>Radicalized</em> is arguably about the very subject drawing many Americans to folks to programs like Medicare For All, the American healthcare system. Doctorow couples the existential despair of watching loved ones die, being dragged down by the bureaucratic nightmare of dealing with insurance, and the joys and pitfalls of relying on online communities to cope. The Masque of the Red Death appropriates Edgar Allen Poe&rsquo;s story of the same name and places in the context of a present day apocalypse level catastrophe. Doctorow follows the survivalist prepper mindset to its logical conclusion, but still manages to present how a better world that can be built.</p>\n\n<p>The book can be read in a long afternoon and I would recommend anyone do so for the same reasons I have found myself returning to Doctorow&rsquo;s work since I read <em>Little Brother</em> in high school: He presents versions of the world that exist, or with just a dial turned in any direction, could exist, but his characters do not wallow in despair and the solutions do not come from bootstrapping, mythical individuals. They are about average people who, in the face of dystopia, work together to build a better world.</p>\n",

I'm hesitant to call this a review, but I am happy to call these my notes. \n\n*Radicalized*  is a collection of four short stories that grapple with the world we live in today. Appropriately, the back cover of the book reads, \"Dystopia is now.\" Their underpinning thematic link is the fact that the world we are building and the world we live in is not necessarily a world to be celebrated. \n\n*Unauthorized Bread* presents us a world where the poorest among us must deal with the impact of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act coupled with integrating software into all of our appliances, how capitalism seeks to always bring things outside of the market into the market, and how those impacted by corporate excesses work together to make workarounds for themselves. Model Minority is the superhero story I've wanted for so long. Doctorow cribs directly from DC, takes their most well known characters, and makes them reckon with their role in imperialism, the police state, and how, for so long, they've done nothing to address the injustices that exist within those systems. It's like Doctorow read [Kotaku's review of Marvel's Spider-Man](https://kotaku.com/spider-mans-take-on-police-feels-out-of-touch-1828978785) and felt compelled to do address it. \n\n*Radicalized* is arguably about the very subject drawing many Americans to folks to programs like Medicare For All, the American healthcare system. Doctorow couples the existential despair of watching loved ones die, being dragged down by the bureaucratic nightmare of dealing with insurance, and the joys and pitfalls of relying on online communities to cope. The Masque of the Red Death appropriates Edgar Allen Poe's story of the same name and places in the context of a present day apocalypse level catastrophe. Doctorow follows the survivalist prepper mindset to its logical conclusion, but still manages to present how a better world that can be built. \n\nThe book can be read in a long afternoon and I would recommend anyone do so for the same reasons I have found myself returning to Doctorow's work since I read *Little Brother* in high school: He presents versions of the world that exist, or with just a dial turned in any direction, could exist, but his characters do not wallow in despair and the solutions do not come from bootstrapping, mythical individuals. They are about average people who, in the face of dystopia, work together to build a better world. \n",
