I sit in the camp for as long as I can but the flickering light of the candelabra and the dull throb of my ankle aren&rsquo;t the best company. I pull out the map and study it. The encounter with the gargoyle has me considering returning home but it&rsquo;s then I remember that there is nothing  athome. I took the map because it&rsquo;s all that was left in the ruins. Crossing this stupid sea and following this heirloom map won&rsquo;t bring anyone back or re-unite me with them, but trodding this path will make me feel closer to my my family. My village.</p>\n\n<p>Staring at the map fails to give me any new insights. I take out the map Hugo gave me and it&rsquo;s too much new information to take in. Forward motion is the only thing I think I can focus on right now. Where is Hugo? It&rsquo;s been half a day. We need to be getting on. I&rsquo;m not sure this island can even sustain us for much longer and I have enough provisions to cross the sea and get to town for one, but I&rsquo;m not going to let Hugo starve. At this point he&rsquo;s saved my life more than me getting him off this island would save his.</p>\n\n<p>I make my way to our lean-to and lay down. I don&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;ll be leaving today and the events of the last two days have me more drained than I was planning on being this early in the journey. I close my eyes but it&rsquo;s too humid to simply drift away. Eventually, I am able to force myself to sleep.</p>\n\n<p>In the distance I hear something being dragged and some heavy huffing. &ldquo;Hugo,&rdquo; I call out. More huffing. I stand uneasy and limp out of the lean-to. Hugo is dragging something..</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry yourself,&rdquo; Hugo says as I move closer,  &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll put weight on your bad leg if you help.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;What is this?&rdquo; I ask. I could see that it was some sort of chest but I wanted to hear how he left with a jeweled cane handle and came back with this. I notice the handle resting on a belt he fashioned out of string I gave him from my provisions.</p>\n\n<p>He inhales, &ldquo;Well, you won&rsquo;t believe it but I went in search of a fine piece of wood to carve your cane out of.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;You left this morning! What took so long?&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t mean to worry you. It&rsquo;s just when I was looking for the perfect piece of wood I went towards the middle of the isle, figuring the trees would be older, sturdier, have more options. You know?&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>I wasn&rsquo;t sure where this was going, &ldquo;And?&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m at this tree because I haven&rsquo;t found anything good on the ground. I figured I&rsquo;d just take something and dry it out. I mean we&rsquo;ll be rowing and just baking under the candelabra. Probably can dry out right quick. You know?&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; I say.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;And with us taking turns rowing&hellip;&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;I get it,&rdquo; I cut him off, a day of waiting has left me impatient, &ldquo;You&rsquo;d have time to work on carving it.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Yes. So, I&rsquo;m in front of this tree and I&rsquo;m about to climb it. But something&rsquo;s not right,&rdquo; he pauses with an annoying dramatic flair, &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a bump in the ground.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Seems perfectly normal to me,&rdquo; I say.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s where you and I view the world differently. Been around long enough to know trees. These here on the isles don&rsquo;t root like mainland trees. Shouldn&rsquo;t be weird bulges.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Okay.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;So, I start digging.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;You start digging? Based on what?&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>He pauses and looks into my eyes,&ldquo;The bulge &ndash; something&rsquo;s not right.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>I&rsquo;m not sure if it was how he said it or taking the effort to lock his gaze with mine but something about that statement unnerved me, &ldquo;I think I have to take your word for it on this one.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;You do, because I was right,&rdquo; he gestures to the chest, &ldquo;I found some pirate treasure.&rdquo; He smiles.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Pirate treasure?&ldquo;I smirk.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Yep. Just like yer handle. Has to be a pirate.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Why haven&rsquo;t you opened it?&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Locked. I figure you might be able to do something.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;What am I going to do with a locked chest?&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>He smiles, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t play with me here. I&rsquo;ve seen the runes in your journal. I watched you not only survive a gargoyle attack, but a fall from near the rafters. There&rsquo;s a magic coursing through you. Maybe you&rsquo;re not very good with it, but you have it&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Hugo&rsquo;s not wrong. I&rsquo;ve had an affinity for the same magic that powers the Rooks since I was a child. Never terribly controlled and only since adulthood have I been able to muster any control over it. I didn&rsquo;t survive the fall with magic though. Or at least not a single spell came to mind as I watched what was surely my death rapidly approaching.  &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never worked a lock with magic,&rdquo; I tell him.</p>\n\n<p>His eyes widened as though I wasn&rsquo;t understanding his intent, &ldquo;Must you be gentle with it?&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>I could see that he wasn&rsquo;t going to relent on this one. &ldquo;Move it where I can sit in front of it more comfortably.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>We get the chest in a position where I can kneel in front of it. There&rsquo;s a keyhole, metal. The rest of it is made of a heavy wood. I can work with this. I touch two fingers to the keyhole and begin reciting one of the earliest incantations I learned. I raise my other hand to the sky palm out. I don&rsquo;t need much I just need the ambient static from the air. Inhaling and exhaling I can feel the electricity dancing on my palm. I concentrate and let it gather. Finally, I pull it through my body, focus the energy, and loose the concentrated electricity through my fingertips and into the key hole. The wood cracks from the force of the enrgy but the lock becomes a molten mass and begins oozing down the chest.</p>\n\n<p>I exhale and stand. My legs went numb from kneeling and the letting electricity flow through my body always leaves me drained even though it&rsquo;s not shocking me or, maybe, I&rsquo;m somehow inured to it. Either way it&rsquo;s exhausting. &ldquo;Have at it,&rdquo; I say to Hugo.</p>\n\n<p>I sit in the sand and Hugo opens the chest. He&rsquo;s more confused than anything. I watch as he reaches in and pulls out the treasure. It looks like a simple pair of women&rsquo;s boots.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Must have been a lady pirate,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;Are they your size?&rdquo; Hugo hands me the boots. The leather-work is excellent but more than that at the ankles there is an insignia of some kind. Maybe it&rsquo;s from the shoemaker, that would make sense. I study the insignia and realize that it&rsquo;s a rune. A strange dialect of the runic language. Old. Maybe even ancient. The rune doesn&rsquo;t look like anything to avoid. I put the boots on and pace back and forth in front of Hugo.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Get you some winners?&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;I think so,&rdquo; I reply.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;You know it&rsquo;s starting to feel a little unfair that everything so far has been for you.

I could barely make out a figure standing looking out from the tower &ndash; whatever stood theredidn&rsquo;t look human. While I don&rsquo;t have much to lose but this is the beginning of the journey and I&rsquo;m not trying to die on the Deadwe. I continued rowing and rowing and rowing.

I dragged the boat into the trees hoping to use it as a lean-to.</p>\n\n<p>As I was setting up camp I noticed smoke plumes rising not too far away. It looked controlled, like an ordinary camp fire. These isles are more populated than I thought. Cautiously, I treaded towards the plumes. A shell of human in threadbare cloth poked at a meager fire. He didn&rsquo;t look like he posed a threat to me or anyone at all. It was clear to me that his diet had been lean for sometime.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Excuse me,&rdquo; I said once I was within earshot .</p>\n\n<p>The man leapt to his feat and put his fists up. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not here to hurt you.&rdquo; An iron ring of metal encircles each of his wrists and the chain has been broken off. &ldquo;Nor am I here to return you to prison?&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>He lowered his arms, &ldquo;If you&rsquo;re here to do neither of those can you get me off this island? You must have a boat, you&rsquo;re not wet.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;May I ask how you got here?&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;You guessed right. I&rsquo;m an esacpee. My buddy and I were out fishing and we got captured\nby those. Those. Well, I don&rsquo;t know what they are.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>The island with the tower. &ldquo;I think I passed that island. I&rsquo;m Jane by the way. How did you escape? Where&rsquo;s your friend?&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>The man looked a little flustered, &ldquo;lots of questions. You&rsquo;re the first person I talked to in weeks.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Apologies. Take them one at a time.&rdquo; The man&rsquo;s ribcage was even more apparent when he lowered his fists.</p>\n\n<p>I pulled a tin of nuts out of my rucksack, &ldquo;You may be a criminal, but you shouldn&rsquo;t starve. Eat these,&rdquo; I said handing them to the man.</p>\n\n<p>The man stumbled forth and desperately took the tin from her hands. As he shoveled nuts into his mouth he muttered, &ldquo;Name&rsquo;s Hugo. Not a criminal. Fishing&rsquo;s no crime.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Broken manacles suggest otherwise,&rdquo; I said.</p>\n\n<p>Hugo flushed, &ldquo;You&rsquo;d think them the criminals you knew what I been through.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>I decided to take a seat next to his fire. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m here for the evening. What do you got?&rdquo; His story seemed likely. His body was covered in a patchwork of welts and bruises. They weren&rsquo;t fresh but they were there all the same.</p>\n\n<p>Hugo shook his head, &ldquo;My buddy, Fynn. We  was fishing out fishing. Trying to do some deeper fishing. Drifted too close to that island I guess and three swift boats came out and captured us. Must of been in that hell hole for months. Only been here uhh,&rdquo; Hugo lifts the stick he was poking the fire with, &ldquo;I been on this island as many ticks this stick has.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>He&rsquo;s been here for a little under two weeks. I guess he also wasn&rsquo;t being fed before he ended up here. &ldquo;So, what happened when they captured you?&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Well, they had us working on something. Mostly mining. Not something normal to mine though. I can&rsquo;t explain it. Beyond me. Some other prisoners figured something to do with Rooks. Fynn did thought so. He had a real mind for that sort of thing.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;What happened to Fynn?&rdquo; Hugo grimaced as I asked. Something tragic. Died at the camp maybe.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Listen, I just met you and haven&rsquo;t had any time to,&rdquo; his voice trails off.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Your business is your business. Maybe save it.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;We escaped and I made it here. Barely. I&rsquo;d like off this island. I can&rsquo;t offer much, but I have this.&rdquo; Hugo reaches into a tattered sack.  Hugo pulls out a tiny, square container. It must be waterproof. His fingers work the container open and he pulls out a folded vellum map.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;I stole this,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;A pretty detailed map. Has stuff I never seen or heard of. You seem to be on some sort of adventure. I&rsquo;ll give it to you now, if you get me out of here.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>The choice was pretty clear I could use a map and I couldn&rsquo;t let a man die here. &ldquo;Sure, I&rsquo;ll take it. Come back to my camp with me and we&rsquo;ll keep rowing tomorrow.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Where you headed?&rdquo; He asked.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Trying to cross the Deadwe.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>He nods, &ldquo;Trying to get to the city?&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;I want to at least stop in a city.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m not from there but my fishing village not too far off. You get me home and I can get you oriented and provision. My family, well they probably think I&rsquo;m dead, so I can imagine they&rsquo;ll be grateful.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;We need to rest up then if we&rsquo;re going to keep rowing.

You must have a boat, you're not wet.\"\n\n\"May I ask how you got here?\" \n\n\"You guessed right. I'm an esacpee. My buddy and I were out fishing and we got captured\nby those. Those. Well, I don't know what they are.\" \n\nThe island with the tower. \"I think I passed that island. I'm Jane by the way. How did you escape? Where's your friend?\" \n\nThe man looked a little flustered, \"lots of questions. You're the first person I talked to in weeks.\" \n\n\"Apologies. Take them one at a time.\" The man's ribcage was even more apparent when he lowered his fists. \n\nI pulled a tin of nuts out of my rucksack, \"You may be a criminal, but you shouldn't starve. Eat these,\" I said handing them to the man.  \n\nThe man stumbled forth and desperately took the tin from her hands. As he shoveled nuts into his mouth he muttered, \"Name's Hugo. Not a criminal. Fishing's no crime.\" \n\n\"Broken manacles suggest otherwise,\" I said. \n\n Hugo flushed, \"You'd think them the criminals you knew what I been through.\"\n\nI decided to take a seat next to his fire. \"I'm here for the evening. What do you got?\" His story seemed likely. His body was covered in a patchwork of welts and bruises. They weren't fresh but they were there all the same.  \n\nHugo shook his head, \"My buddy, Fynn. We  was fishing out fishing. Trying to do some deeper fishing. Drifted too close to that island I guess and three swift boats came out and captured us. Must of been in that hell hole for months. Only been here uhh,\" Hugo lifts the stick he was poking the fire with, \"I been on this island as many ticks this stick has.\" \n\nHe's been here for a little under two weeks. I guess he also wasn't being fed before he ended up here. \"So, what happened when they captured you?\" \n \n\"Well, they had us working on something. Mostly mining. Not something normal to mine though. I can't explain it. Beyond me. Some other prisoners figured something to do with Rooks. Fynn did thought so. He had a real mind for that sort of thing.\"\n\n\"What happened to Fynn?\" Hugo grimaced as I asked. Something tragic. Died at the camp maybe. \n\n\"Listen, I just met you and haven't had any time to,\" his voice trails off.  \n\n\"Your business is your business. Maybe save it.\"  \n\n\"We escaped and I made it here. Barely. I'd like off this island. I can't offer much, but I have this.\" Hugo reaches into a tattered sack.  Hugo pulls out a tiny, square container. It must be waterproof. His fingers work the container open and he pulls out a folded vellum map. \n\n\"I stole this,\" he says, \"A pretty detailed map. Has stuff I never seen or heard of. You seem to be on some sort of adventure. I'll give it to you now, if you get me out of here.\"\n\nThe choice was pretty clear I could use a map and I couldn't let a man die here. \"Sure, I'll take it. Come back to my camp with me and we'll keep rowing tomorrow.\"\n\n\"Where you headed?\" He asked. \n\n\"Trying to cross the Deadwe.\" \n\nHe nods, \"Trying to get to the city?\" \n\n\"I want to at least stop in a city.\" \n\n\"Well, I'm not from there but my fishing village not too far off. You get me home and I can get you oriented and provision. My family, well they probably think I'm dead, so I can imagine they'll be grateful.\" \n\n\"We need to rest up then if we're going to keep rowing. Who knows if the fair weather will hold.\" \n\n***\n\n### Character Sheet \nName - Jane Minitel   \nClass - The Helmed \nExploration Score - [x][x][ ][ ][ ]  \nCombat Score - [x][x][x][x][x]  \nCalling - Queen   \n\n> \"A map and a key the source of many of my family's tall tales and stories.

The anti-colonial coat served to cloak the holes in the spaces of practice, administration, and governance that needed to be repared; yet often it was expedient to continue inhabiting colonial institutional structures\" (5)\n\nThis quote is here to remind me to do further reading on the topic of decolonization appropriated by imperial powers towards their own ends. \n\n> \"The World Bank, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, and the US Department of State encourage start-ups, hackathons, and \"innovation cultures\" to redirect energized, dangerous Third World bodies away from terrorism into entrepreneurship.\n\nThis has echoes of the \"Learn to Code\" mantra in the US. \n\n>  \"Firms do not simply try to obliterate difference; rather, they study difference as a tactic of transforming citizen-subjects into consumer-entrepreneurs through techniques of empathetic design thinking and NGO partnerships\" (7)\n\n> \"Culture and innovation industries now systematically take up counterhegemonic efforts, profitably stripping them of their activist intent (Costanza-Chock, 2018, p.12).\" A celebration of difference alone is not enough to sustain a pluriverse -- a \"world where many worlds fit\" (Escobar, 2018, p.16).\n\nThese last two pieces clearly elucidate the point that by and large capitalism can always co-opt a movement and have it exist within its own bounds. The point here that I find important is that *merely* decentralizing our computing infrastructure will not necessarily yield liberatory results. \n\n## References to Read \n\n\"The Wretech of the Earth\", Fanon, F. \n",

They are saved for another day, probably tomorrow. \n\nISSN: 2380-3312 - Source: Catalyst: feminism, theory, technoscience \n\n## Summary\nThe authors provide a survey of where discussions of technology were going before media and globalizations studies turned optimistic. The authors suggest that by going back and egnaging with the black radical theoretical tradition as well as incorporating indigenous and decolonial critiques we can move beyond the focus of knowledge production and back towards creating a collective imagination. \n\n## Quotes \n\n> \"It was through these movements for decolonization and racial and economic justice where we first see calls for self-reliance and ultimately \"liberated mediat infrastructures to combat colonial propaganda and build transational circuits of transport and communication (radio and newspapers) in the services of the commons (Arough & Chakravartty 2016, p. 563) (2)\"\n\n\n> \"The post-Cold war era of a seemingly peaceful global order alongside the worldwide proliferation of neo-liberal media and computer infrastructure has further shifted the interest in the fields of communication and media studies away from engagement with colonial violence and what political scientist Cedric Robinson termed \"racial capitalism\" (1983).
